### Isolate bacterial gDNA (Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus kit, Zymo research) 

Follow kit instructions for cultured cells (which includes bacteria) with implemented differences (i.e., lysis time and additional centerfugation time prior to elution)

### Set up PCR

For Q5 DNA polymerase, set up the PCR as follows: 

|Component |1x volume | [Final] | Check when added |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H20* | ... | ... |  |
| 5x Q5 reaction buffer | 10 uL | 1x |  | 
| 10 mM dNTPs | 1 uL | ... |  | 
| Forward primer | ... | ... |  | 
| Reverse primer | ... | ... |  | 
| Q5 Taq polymerase* | 0.5 uL | ... |  | 
| Total | 45 uL |  |  | 

*Amount of H20 can change to accomidate more dilute gDNA concentrations
*Add enzyme last!

To a PCR tube, add 45 uL of PCR mix and 5 uL of gDNA (... ng/uL)
...
