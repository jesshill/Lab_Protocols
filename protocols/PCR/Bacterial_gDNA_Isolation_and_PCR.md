### Isolate bacterial gDNA (Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus kit, Zymo research) 

Follow kit instructions for cultured cells (which includes bacteria) with implemented differences (i.e., lysis time and additional centerfugation time prior to elution)

### Set up PCR

For Q5 DNA polymerase, set up the PCR as follows: 

|Component |1x volume | #x volume | [Final] | Check when added |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H20* | 33 uL | ... | ... |  |
| 5X Q5 reaction buffer | 10 uL | ... | 1X |  |
| 10 mM dNTPs | 1 uL | ... | ... |  |
| Forward primer (100 uM) | 0.25 uL | ... | ... |  |
| Reverse primer (100 uM) | 0.25 uL | ... | ... |  |
| Q5 Taq polymerase* | 0.5 uL | ... | ... |  |
| Total | 45 uL | # uL |  |  |

*Amount of H20 can change to accomidate more dilute gDNA concentrations

*Add enzyme last!

To a PCR tube, add 45 uL of PCR mix and 5 uL of gDNA (... ng/uL) for a total reaction volume of 50 uL.

### Run PCR

Add sample tubes to the thermocycler.

Run the PCR with the following thermocycle settings:
- 98C 30sec
  - 98C 10sec
  - 65C 30sec
  - 72C 10min
  - repeat for a total of 30X cycles! 
- 72C 2min 
- 12C hold
