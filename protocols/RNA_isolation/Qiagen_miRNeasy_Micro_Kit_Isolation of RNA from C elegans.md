### REAGENTS

miRNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen; 217084)

`	`Specifications:

`   	`Purification of total RNA, including miRNA, from animal and human cells and tissues

`	   `Sample amount: < 5 mg of animal tissue

`	   `RNeasy MinElute Spin Column (stored at 4C, elution volume: 10 – 14 uL, max binding capacity: 45 µg, max loading vol: 700 µL, min elution vol: 10 µL)

TRIzol (Invitrogen; cat: 15596-026) or QIAzol (Qiagen; cat: 79306)

RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen; cat: 79254) – DNase I for on-column digestion

**CAUTION**

DO NOT add bleach or acidic solutions directly to the sample-preparation waste.

Both QIAzol Lysis Reagent and Buffer RWT contain guanidine thiocyanate, which can form highly reactive compounds when combined with bleach. QIAzol Lysis Reagent contains phenol and guanidine thiocyanate which are toxic and corrosive. 

**BEFORE STARTING**

Buffers RWT and RPE are supplied as concentrates. Before using for the first time, add the required volumes of ethanol (96–100%), as indicated on the bottle, to obtain a working solution. We however prepare the RWT with 45 mL of 100% Isopropanol rather than the 30 mL of 100% EtOH. We prepare the RPE as directed by adding 44 mL of 100% EtOH.

Prepare 80% ethanol with 100% ethanol and RNase-free water.

### PROTOCOL
1. Cool microcentrifuge to 4C
1. Disrupt the worms/cells through 3 rounds of freeze-thaw using liquid nitrogen (thaw cells at 37C; post thaw vortex samples; then re-freeze in liquid nitrogen).  
1. Place the tube containing the homogenate on the benchtop at room temperature for 5 min. 
1. Add Phenol:Chloroform at a 1:5 ratio with the sample volume. Vortex the tube vigorously for 15 s.
   1. For samples extracted in 700 µL of QIAzol, add 140 µL Phenol:Chloroform to the tube containing the homogenate and cap it securely.
1. Place the tube containing the homogenate on the benchtop at room temperature for 3 min.
1. Centrifuge for 15 min at 12,000 x g at 4°C. 
   1. After centrifugation, the sample separates into 3 phases: an upper, colorless, aqueous phase containing RNA; a white interphase; and a lower, red, organic phase. 
1. Transfer the upper aqueous phase to a new collection tube. 
1. Add 1.5 volumes of 100% ethanol and mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down several times. Do not centrifuge. **Continue without delay to the next step.**
1. Pipet up to 700 µL of the sample, including any precipitate that may have formed, into an RNeasy MinElute spin column in a 2 mL collection tube (supplied). 
1. Centrifuge at ≥ 8000 x g for 30 s at room temperature. Discard the flow-through.
1. Add the remainder of the sample into the RNeasy MinElute spin column, and centrifuge at ≥ 8000 x g for 30 s at room temperature. Discard the flowthrough.
1. Pipette 350 μL Buffer RWT (prepared with isopropanol) into the RNeasy MinElute spin column and centrifuge for 30 s at ≥8000 x g to wash. Discard the flow-through.
1. On Column DNase digestion for samples containing <1 μg
   1. In a separate tube, add 10 μL DNase I stock solution to 70 μL Buffer RDD per RNA isolation. Mix by gently inverting the tube. Do not vortex.
   1. Pipet the DNase I incubation mix (80 μL) directly onto the RNeasy MinElute spin column membrane and place on the benchtop at RT for 15 min.
      1. Note: Make sure to pipet the DNase I incubation mix directly onto the RNeasy membrane. DNase digestion will be incomplete if part of the mix sticks to the walls or the O-ring of the RNeasy MinElute spin column.
1. Pipette 500 μL Buffer RWT (prepared with isopropanol) into the RNeasy MinElute spin column and centrifuge for 30 s at ≥8000 x g. Keep the flow-through.
1. Reapply the flow-through to the RNeasy MinElute spin column and centrifuge for 30 s at ≥8000 x g. Discard the flow-through.
1. Pipette 500 µL Buffer RPE onto the RNeasy MinElute spin column. Close the lid gently and centrifuge for 30 s at ≥8000 x g to wash the column. Discard the flow-through.
1. Pipette 500 µL of 80% ethanol onto the RNeasy MinElute spin column. Centrifuge for 2 min at ≥ 8000 x g to wash the spin column membrane. Discard the collection tube with the flow-through.
1. After centrifugation, carefully remove the RNeasy MinElute spin column from the collection tube so that the column does not contact the flow-through. Otherwise, carryover of ethanol will occur.
1. Place the RNeasy MinElute spin column into a new 2 mL collection tube. Open the lid of the spin column and centrifuge at full speed for 5 min to dry the membrane. Discard the collection tube with the flow-through.
   1. To avoid damage to their lids, place the spin columns into the centrifuge with at least one empty position between columns. Orient the lids so that they point in a direction opposite to the rotation of the rotor (e.g., if the rotor rotates clockwise, orient the lids counterclockwise).
   1. It is important to dry the spin column membrane, since residual ethanol may interfere with downstream reactions. Centrifugation with the lids open ensures that no ethanol is carried over during RNA elution
1. Place the RNeasy MinElute spin column in a new 1.5 mL collection tube. Add 14 µL RNase-free water directly to the center of the spin column membrane. Incubate sample for 2 min at RT. Centrifuge for 1 min at full speed to elute the RNA.

### QUBIT FLUOROMETER

The Qubit protocol can be found under the Qubit machine. Qubit assay tubes, Qubit Reagent, and Qubit Buffer are stored at RT above the machine. Qubit Standards are kept in the door of Robs fridge. Allow Qubit standards to equilibrate at room temp for 30 minutes prior to use. 

The Qubit light path is horizontal, so only label the tops of Qubit Assay Tubes.

1. Make Qubit working solution out of Qubit Reagent and Qubit Buffer (need to choose between RNA BR or HS). 

   Qubit RNA BR (broad range) Reagent

   Qubit RNA HS (high sensitivity) Reagent

   \# = number of samples + 2 standards

   vol. Qubit Reagent = # \* 1 uL

   vol. Qubit Buffer = # \* 199 uL 

2. Make standard solutions in Qubit Assay Tubes (need to choose between RNA BR or HS standards). 
   1. Label tubes for standard 1 and standard 2. Combine 190 uL of Qubit working solution with 10 uL of standard 1. Repeat for standard 2. 

   Qubit RNA BR Standards (10 – 1,200 ng)

   Standard 1 (cat #: Q10210 C)

   Standard 2 (cat #: Q10210 D)

   Qubit RNA HS Standards (4 – 200 ng)

   Standard 1 (cat #: Q32852 C)

   Standard 2 (cat #: Q32852 D)

3. Prepare samples in Qubit Assay Tubes. 
   1. Combine 198 uL of Qubit working solution with 2 uL of sample.
4. Vortex all tubes (standards and samples) for about 3 sec. 
5. Lightly microfuge to bring contents down to the bottom of assay tubes.   
6. Incubate tubes for 2 min at RT. 
7. Now read standards then samples on Qubit.

### TAPESTATION

Is an automated electrophoresis solution for the sample quality control of DNA and RNA samples. It is suitable to analyze size, quantity, and integrity of the samples. 

For RNA samples, look for a 2:1 ratio of 28S to 18S in eukaryotic RNA to determine if intact.

RNA integrity number (RIN) value is calculated from the overall trace, including degraded products, which is better than just assessing the rRNA peaks alone.    

The Agilent High Sensitivity RNA ScreenTape Assay (tape and reagents) is stored at 4C in the door of Robs fridge. This assay is for a sample range between 500 – 10,000 pg/uL (max is 10 ng) and 100 – 6000 nt. 

HS RNA ScreenTape (Agilent; cat: 5067-5579)

HS RNA ScreenTape Ladder (Agilent; cat: 5067-5581)

HS RNA ScreenTape Sample Buffer (Agilent; cat: 5067-5580)

1. Reagents need to equilibrate at room temp for 30 minutes prior to use.
2. Thaw HS RNA Ladder and total RNA samples on ice. 
3. Vortex reagents and samples. Spin down before use. 
4. Dilute samples if needed.
   1. Dilute samples to 5 ng/uL, for a total of 10 ng. 

*(1 uL sample)(# ng/uL from Qubit) = (5 ng/uL)(x)*

5. If using a new RNA Ladder, need to dilute it first and prior to use. Dilute by adding 10 uL of RNase free water and mixing. 
6. Prepare samples and ladder in assay tubes.
   1. Add 1 uL of Sample Buffer to 2 uL of sample
   1. Add 1 uL of Sample Buffer to 2 uL of RNA Ladder  
7. Cap assay tubes
8. Vortex tubes using IKA vortexer at 2000 rpm for 1 min. 
9. Spin down samples and ladder for 1 min.
10. Denature samples and ladder.
   1. Heat to 72C for 3 min
11. Place samples and ladder on ice for 2 min. 
12. Spin down samples and ladder for 1 min. 
13. Walk to 4150 TapeStation in MQC (4<sup>th</sup> floor of MRB, room 406)
   1. Need to bring tips, ScreenTape, and samples
14. Carefully remove assay tube caps without disturbing samples. 
15. Place tube strip, tips, and ScreenTape into TapeStation.
   1. Flick ScreenTape prior to inserting into machine! 
   1. Always use a full strip of tubes in the machine, even if don’t need all the tubes. This will prevent single tubes or short strips from being sucked up by the machine. 
16. Make software selections (Eukaryotic RNA protocol) and start run.
