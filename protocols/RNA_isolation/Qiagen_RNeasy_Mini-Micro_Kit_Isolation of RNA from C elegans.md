### PROTOCOL

1. Wipe down the bench, centrifuge, and pipettes with an RNase inhibitor (i.e., RNase Away).
1. Cool microcentrifuge to 4C. 
1. Harvest worms
   1. Wash 2x with sterile M9, end with 100 uL of worm pellet, then add 1 mL of TRIzol. 
   1. Worm pellet should be <10% of TRIzol volume added. 
      1. TRIzol is a monophasic solution of phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate, designed to isolate separate fractions of RNA, DNA, and proteins from samples. Guanidine isothiocyanate is a chaotropic salt that protects RNA from RNases. 
1. Homogenize tissue by performing 3 freeze/thaw/vortex cycles. 
   1. If tubes are already frozen, place in 37C bead bath until thawed, then vortex, then place in liquid nitrogen until frozen (~30 sec).  
   1. If tubes are not frozen, place in liquid nitrogen until frozen (~30 sec), then place in 37C bead bath until thawed, then vortex. 
   1. Repeat 2 more times. 
1. Add 0.2 volumes of Phenol:Chloroform to samples, then pipette mix. 
   1. For a total sample volume of 1100 uL, add 220 uL of Phenol:Chloroform (1:5 ratio). 
      1. Chloroform is added to help with phase separation, which is obtained by centrifuging the sample. 
1. Shake tubes by hand for 20 sec. Then incubate samples at RT for 3 minutes. 
1. Separate phases by centrifugation (>10,000g, 18 min, 4C). 
1. Remove aqueous phase (is top, clear layer) and transfer to a new microfuge tube. 
   1. Don’t be greedy! Leave the interface alone. 
   1. RNA remains exclusively in the aqueous phase in the presence of guanidine isothiocyanate, while DNA and protein go into the organic phase and interphase. 
1. Add an equal volume of 100% EtOH to aqueous phase, and pipette mix or shake by hand.  
   1. RNA is recovered from the aqueous phase by precipitation with alcohol. 
1. Transfer 700 uL of sample to spin column.
1. Adhere RNA to column by spinning (>8,000g, 30 sec, RT). Then discard flow through.
   1. Repeat step for any additional sample remaining.
1. Add 350 uL of RW1 to wash. Then spin (>8,000g, 30 sec, RT) and discard flow through. 
1. Perform on-column digestion by adding 80 uL of DNase I/RDD to sample column. Incubate for 15 min at RT. 
   1. To prepare, add 70 uL of RDD buffer to 1 aliquot of DNase I stock. DNase I stock is 10 uL aliquot of 2.7 U/uL.
      1. DNase treatments can occur either in solution or on-column, depending on isolation method. On-column DNase treatments are common with silica matrix extraction, and unlike in solution treatments, do not need to be heat inactivated in the presence of EDTA because salt washes remove the enzyme. 
1. Add 350 uL of RW1 to wash. Then spin (>8,000g, 30 sec, RT) and discard flow through. 
   1. Optional: Rather than discarding the flowthrough, reapply to the column. Then spin again. Now can discard the flow through. 
1. Transfer column to a new collection tube. 
1. (Make sure RPE contains added EtOH) Add 500 uL of RPE to wash. Then spin (>8,000g, 30 sec, RT) and discard flow through. 
1. Wash again by adding 500 uL of RPE. Spin (>8,000g, 2 min, RT) and discard flow through. 
1. Spin for an additional minute to further dry column membrane (>8,000g, 1 min, RT). 
1. Transfer the column to a fresh microfuge collection tube with lid. 
1. Elute RNA from the column by adding desired volume of RNase-Free water. Incubate column for 2 min at RT. Then spin (>8,000g, 1 min, RT). 
   1. See kit specifications for information on elution volumes.  
1. Quantify RNA on the Qubit, and then check RNA quality by running 1 – 2 ug on a prepared gel or by running on the TapeStation. 
   1. Removal of residual quinidine, phenol, and alcohol from samples is important, as they can reduce cDNA synthesis efficiency.

### QUBIT FLUOROMETER

The Qubit protocol can be found under the Qubit machine. Qubit assay tubes, Qubit Reagent, and Qubit Buffer are stored at RT above the machine. Qubit Standards are kept in the door of Robs fridge. Allow Qubit standards to equilibrate at room temp for 30 minutes prior to use. 

The Qubit light path is horizontal, so only label the tops of Qubit Assay Tubes.

1. Make Qubit working solution out of Qubit Reagent and Qubit Buffer (need to choose between RNA BR or HS). 

   Qubit RNA BR (broad range) Reagent

   Qubit RNA HS (high sensitivity) Reagent

   \# = number of samples + 2 standards

   vol. Qubit Reagent = # \* 1 uL

   vol. Qubit Buffer = # \* 199 uL 

2. Make standard solutions in Qubit Assay Tubes (need to choose between RNA BR or HS standards). 
   1. Label tubes for standard 1 and standard 2. Combine 190 uL of Qubit working solution with 10 uL of standard 1. Repeat for standard 2. 

   Qubit RNA BR Standards (10 – 1,200 ng)

   Standard 1 (cat #: Q10210 C)

   Standard 2 (cat #: Q10210 D)

   Qubit RNA HS Standards (4 – 200 ng)

   Standard 1 (cat #: Q32852 C)

   Standard 2 (cat #: Q32852 D)

3. Prepare samples in Qubit Assay Tubes. 
   1. Combine 198 uL of Qubit working solution with 2 uL of sample.
4. Vortex all tubes (standards and samples) for about 3 sec. 
5. Lightly microfuge to bring contents down to the bottom of assay tubes.   
6. Incubate tubes for 2 min at RT. 
7. Now read standards then samples on Qubit.

### TAPESTATION

Is an automated electrophoresis solution for the sample quality control of DNA and RNA samples. It is suitable to analyze size, quantity, and integrity of the samples. 

For RNA samples, look for a 2:1 ratio of 28S to 18S in eukaryotic RNA to determine if intact.

RNA integrity number (RIN) value is calculated from the overall trace, including degraded products, which is better than just assessing the rRNA peaks alone.    

The Agilent High Sensitivity RNA ScreenTape Assay (tape and reagents) is stored at 4C in the door of Robs fridge. This assay is for a sample range between 500 – 10,000 pg/uL (max is 10 ng) and 100 – 6000 nt. 

HS RNA ScreenTape (Agilent; cat: 5067-5579)

HS RNA ScreenTape Ladder (Agilent; cat: 5067-5581)

HS RNA ScreenTape Sample Buffer (Agilent; cat: 5067-5580)

1. Reagents need to equilibrate at room temp for 30 minutes prior to use.
2. Thaw HS RNA Ladder and total RNA samples on ice. 
3. Vortex reagents and samples. Spin down before use. 
4. Dilute samples if needed.
   1. Dilute samples to 5 ng/uL, for a total of 10 ng. 

*(1 uL sample)(# ng/uL from Qubit) = (5 ng/uL)(x)*

5. If using a new RNA Ladder, need to dilute it first and prior to use. Dilute by adding 10 uL of RNase free water and mixing. 
6. Prepare samples and ladder in assay tubes.
   1. Add 1 uL of Sample Buffer to 2 uL of sample
   1. Add 1 uL of Sample Buffer to 2 uL of RNA Ladder  
7. Cap assay tubes
8. Vortex tubes using IKA vortexer at 2000 rpm for 1 min. 
9. Spin down samples and ladder for 1 min.
10. Denature samples and ladder.
      1. Heat to 72C for 3 min
11. Place samples and ladder on ice for 2 min. 
12. Spin down samples and ladder for 1 min. 
13. Walk to 4150 TapeStation in MQC (4<sup>th</sup> floor of MRB, room 406)
      1. Need to bring tips, ScreenTape, and samples
14. Carefully remove assay tube caps without disturbing samples. 
15. Place tube strip, tips, and ScreenTape into TapeStation.
      1. Flick ScreenTape prior to inserting into machine! 
      1. Always use a full strip of tubes in the machine, even if don’t need all the tubes. This will prevent single tubes or short strips from being sucked up by the machine. 
16. Make software selections (Eukaryotic RNA protocol) and start run.
