## miRNeasy Micro RNA Isolation Protocol

**Date:** 01-12-2020

**Author:** Nishimura lab

--- 

**PURPOSE:** For purification of total RNA, including miRNA, from animal and human cells and tissues

**STARTING MATERIAL:** No more than 5 mg of animal cells or tissue.

**CAUTION:** DO NOT add bleach or acidic solutions directly to the sample-preparation waste.

Both QIAzol Lysis Reagent and Buffer RWT contain guanidine thiocyanate, which can form highly reactive compounds when combined with bleach. QIAzol Lysis Reagent contains phenol and guanidine thiocyanate which are toxic and corrosive. 


**BEFORE STARTING:** 

- Buffers RWT and RPE are supplied as concentrates. Before using for the first time, add the required volumes of ethanol (96–100%), as indicated on the bottle, to obtain a working solution.
- Prepare 80% ethanol with ethanol (96–100%) and RNase-free water.

**NOTES:**

**PROTOCOL**

RNA ISOLATION

1. Cool centrifuge to 4°C
1. Disrupt the cells through three rounds of freeze-thaw using liquid nitrogen
1. Place the tube containing the homogenate on the benchtop at room temperature (15–25°C) for 5 min.
1. For samples extracted in 700 ul of QIAzol, add 140 µl chloroform to the tube containing the homogenate and cap it securely. Vortex the tube vigorously for 15 s. 
   1. Otherwise, add 200 uL of chloroform per 1 mL of QIAzol.
1. Place the tube containing the homogenate on the benchtop at room temperature for 2–3 min.
1. Centrifuge for 15 min at 12,000 x g at 4°C. After centrifugation, heat the centrifuge up to room temperature (15–25°C) if the same centrifuge will be used for the next centrifugation steps.
   1. After centrifugation, the sample separates into 3 phases: an upper, colorless, aqueous phase containing RNA; a white interphase; and a lower, red, organic phase. The volume of the aqueous phase should be approximately 350 µl.
1. Transfer the upper aqueous phase to a new collection tube. Add 1.5 volumes (usually 525 µl) of 100% ethanol and mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down several times. Do not centrifuge. **Continue without delay to the next step.**
1. Pipet up to 700 µl of the sample, including any precipitate that may have formed, into an RNeasy MinElute spin column in a 2 ml collection tube (supplied). Close the lid gently and centrifuge at ≥8000 x g (≥10,000 rpm) for 15 s at room temperature (15–25°C). Discard the flow-through.

**Note: Do not discard any of the following flowthroughs in a liquid waste vessel that contains bleach**

1. Add the remainder of the sample into the RNeasy MinElute spin column, and centrifuge at ≥8000 x g (≥10,000 rpm) for 15 s at room temperature. Discard the flowthrough.
1. ` `*Skip this step if performing on column digestion:* Add 700 ul Buffer RWT to the RNeasy MinElute spin column. Centrifuge at ≥8000 x g (≥10,000 rpm) for 15 s at room temperature. Discard the flow-through.
1. ` `On Column DNase digestion for samples containing <1 μg
   1. Pipet 350 μl Buffer RWT (prepared with isopropanol) into the RNeasy MinElute spin column and centrifuge for 15 s at ≥8000 x g (≥10,000 rpm) to wash. Discard the flow-through.
   1. In a separate tube, add 10 μl DNase I stock solution to 70 μl Buffer RDD per RNA isolation. Mix by gently inverting the tube. Do not vortex.
   1. Pipet the DNase I incubation mix (80 μl) directly onto the RNeasy MinElute spin column membrane and place on the benchtop at 20– 30oC for 15 min.
      1. Note: Make sure to pipet the DNase I incubation mix directly onto the RNeasy membrane. DNase digestion will be incomplete if part of the mix sticks to the walls or the O-ring of the RNeasy MinElute spin column.
   1. Pipet 500 μl Buffer RWT (prepared with isopropanol) into the RNeasy
   1. MinElute spin column and centrifuge for 15 s at ≥8000 x g (≥10,000 rpm). Keep the flow-through.
   1. Reapply the flow-through to the RNeasy MinElute spin column and centrifuge for 15 s at ≥8000 x g (≥10,000 rpm). Discard the flow-through.
1. Pipet 500 µl Buffer RPE onto the RNeasy MinElute spin column. Close the lid gently and centrifuge for 15 s at ≥8000 x g (≥10,000 rpm) to wash the column. Discard the flow-through.
1. Pipet 500 µl of 80% ethanol onto the RNeasy MinElute spin column. Close the lid gently and centrifuge for 2 min at ≥8000 x g (≥10,000 rpm) to wash the spin column membrane. Discard the collection tube with the flow-through.
   1. After centrifugation, carefully remove the RNeasy MinElute spin column from the collection tube so that the column does not contact the flow-through. Otherwise, carryover of ethanol will occur.
1. Place the RNeasy MinElute spin column into a new 2 ml collection tube (supplied). Open the lid of the spin column, and centrifuge at full speed for 5 min to dry the membrane. Discard the collection tube with the flow-through.
   1. To avoid damage to their lids, place the spin columns into the centrifuge with at least one empty position between columns. Orient the lids so that they point in a direction opposite to the rotation of the rotor (e.g., if the rotor rotates clockwise, orient the lids counterclockwise).
   1. It is important to dry the spin column membrane, since residual ethanol may interfere with downstream reactions. Centrifugation with the lids open ensures that no ethanol is carried over during RNA elution
1. Place the RNeasy MinElute spin column in a new 1.5 ml collection tube (supplied). Add 14 µl RNase-free water directly to the center of the spin column membrane. Close the lid gently, and centrifuge for 1 min at full speed to elute the RNA.

RNA QUANTIFICATION

Qubit

- Make working solution of Qubit reagent and Qubit buffer

\# = number of samples + 2 standards = 

Vol. Qubit Reagent = # \* 1 uL = 

Vol. Qubit Buffer = # \* 199 uL = 

- Make standard solutions: In the Assay Tubes supplied with the Qubit kit, combine 190 uL of working solution with 10 uL of standard 1, and an additional tube with 190 uL working solution and 10 uL standard 2. Clearly mark the lid of each tube.
- Make user samples: combine 2 uL of sample with 198 uL of working solution.
- Vortex all tubes for 2-3 seconds
- Incubate the tubes for 2 minutes at room temperature.
- Insert the tubes into the Qubit Flourometer and take readings

Tapestation

***For High Sensitivity RNA ScreenTape Assay: When sample range is between 500-10,000 pg/uL and 100 – 6000 nt***

- Prepare Tapestation. Turn on the tapestation and launch the Agilent 2200 Tapestation software.
- Load RNA ScreenTape and loading tips into 2200 Tapestation.
- Select Eukaryotic RNA protocol
- Allow reagents to equilibrate at room temperatyre for 30 mintes
