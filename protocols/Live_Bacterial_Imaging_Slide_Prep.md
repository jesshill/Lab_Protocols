1. Grow worm(s) to desired stage, on bacterial diet(s) of interest. 
   - Embryo prep desired worm strain, then let embryos hatch overnight.
   - Plate L1s on bacterial diet of interest and grow for desired time at 25C.
   - If need to swap to a different diet at some point, plan that into the growth time. 
2. Collect worms from plates (generally 2 small plates is enough) into a 15 mL conical tube using M9.
3. Pellet worms (2000g for 1 min) and remove supernatant.
4. Wash 3 times with M9.
5. On the last wash, aspirate as much supernatent as possible and then resuspend in ~2 mL of 25mM Sodium Azide. 
6. Incubate for about ~ 1 min.
7. Pellet worms (2000g for 1 min) and remove supernatent, leaving ~50 uL or so (this is dependent on how big your worm pellet is).
8. Prepare your slide by pipetting 8-10 uL of sample onto the center of a microscope slide. Cover with a square (22x22 mm) coverslip, and then seal by valaping the edges.
