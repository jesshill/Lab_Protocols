1. Collect worms from plates into a 15 mL conical tube using M9.
1. Spin down @2000g for 1 min, remove supernatant and wash in M9 a total of 3 times. On the last wash, resuspend in 5mL of M9. 
1. Move 1mL into an eppi and spin down @2500g for 1 min.
   1. NOTE: The amount of M9 resuspended in in step 2 and the amount in step 3 will depend on how many worms you have in your prep. I used 2 small plates to generate this protocol and these steps gave an appropriate concentration of worms on the final slide. 
1. Remove supernatant and resuspend in 400uL of 25mM Sodium Azide. 
1. Incubate for 2 minutes then spin down @2500g for 1 minute. 
   1. NOTE: Sodium Azide generally works very fast. Still, check after the incubation under the dissecting scope to ensure full paralysis. 
1. OPTIONAL: Add 750uL of 1% bleach in M9 and incubate for 30 seconds, turning the eppi over in your hand. Immediately spin down @2500g for 1 minute.
1. OPTIONAL: Immediately remove supernatant and quench bleaching with 1mL M9. 
1. Wash 3 times with M9, then resuspend in 50uL of 25mM Sodium Azide.
1. Prepare slide by pipetting 10uL onto center of slide, covering, and then valaping.
