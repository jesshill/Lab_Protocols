### Needed Reagents

1. Egg Buffer or Egg Salts
- Make in a nuclease (RNAse/DNAse) free 50 mL conical tube. Store at RT. 

|**Stock Reagent**|**Volume**|**Final Concentration**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|5 M NaCl|1\.18 mL|118 mM|
|1 M KCl|2\.4 mL|48 mM|
|1 M CaCl2|100 uL|2 mM|
|1 M MgCl2|100 uL|2 mM|
|ddH2O|46\.22 mL||
|**Total**|**50 mL**||

2. Stock Levamisole Solution 
- Make in a nuclease free 15 mL conical tube. Dissolve 241 mg of Levamisole (Sigma Aldrich; L9756-10G) in 10 mL sterile ddH2O, yielding 100 mM solution. Vortex to dissolve. 
- Make 500 uL aliquots in nuclease free microfuge tubes, and store at -20C. 
- Stocks can be de-frosted and stored at 4C for a week at a time. 

3. 20 mg/mL stock BSA Solution
- Make in a nuclease free microfuge tube. Dissolve 20 mg of acetylated BSA (VWR; 97061-420) into 1 mL of sterile ddH20. Vortex to dissolve.
- Make 50 uL aliquots in nuclease free microfuge tubes, and store at -20C.

### Equipment
1. 2-well Concavity slide (Electron Microscopy Sciences; 71878-08)
2. Mouth aspirator tube (Millipore Sigma; A5177-5EA)
3. 2 sets of microcapillary pipettes, one set with an opening diameter of 100 um (5 unit internal diameter distance) and another with an opening diameter of 50 um (3 unit internal diameter distance). 
   1. Prepare at least 5 of each ahead of time to ensure you have enough.
   1. First, pull standard glass capillaries (4 in long and 1.2 mm outer diameter) into an injection needle shape using a Sutter Instruments P-1000 needle puller and conditions for “Adherent Cell, *C. elegans, & Drosophila*” from the Sutter Instruments Pipette Cookbook (Conditions: Heat = Ramp+5; Pull = 100; Vel. = 75; Delay = 90; Pressure = 500; 2.5 x 2.5 mm Box). 
   1. Then, forge the microcapillary pipettes to either the 50 µm (3 unit) or the 100 µm (5 unit) size using a MF-900 microforge. The 50 um and 100 um size represents the estimated opening diameter of the microcapillary pipette. 3 unit measures an internal diameter distance of 3 tick marks as indicated by the MF-900 microforge ocular ruler under the M5/0.1 objective. 5 unit measures an internal diameter distance of 5 tick marks under the same conditions. 
4. Worm pick
5. 35 mm petri dish (Olympus Plastics; 32-103)
6. Hypodermic needle (27G x ½”) attached to a 1 mL syringe (with plunger removed) 
7. Dissecting scope (fluorescent or not)
8. Ice bucket 

### Protocol
1. Prepare the following buffers the day of dissections:
   1. 1 mg/mL working BSA Solution:
      1. In a nuclease free microfuge tube, dilute 50 uL of 20 mg/mL stock BSA solution into 950 uL of ddH20. 
      1. Store on ice. 
   2. 5 mL of Dissection Buffer: 
      1. In a nuclease free 15 mL conical tube, combine 4.875 mL of Egg Salts with 125 uL of 1 M HEPES (pH 7.4).    
      1. Final concentration of HEPES is 48 mM. 
      1. For 10 mL, combine 9.75 mL of Egg Salts with 250 uL of 1 M HEPES.
   3. Chelation Buffer:
      1. In a nuclease free microfuge tube, combine:
         1. 36.5 uL of Dissection Buffer
         1. 6.2 uL of 100 mM EGTA
         1. 6.8 uL of 100 mM MgCl2
         1. 4 uL of RNAsin (Promega; N251B) \*stored at -20C
      1. Make multiple sets for use during intestine isolations (1 per 10 worms).
      1. Keep on ice.
   4. 2 mM working Levamisole Solution: 
      1. In a nuclease free microfuge tube, dilute 7 uL of 100 mM stock Levamisole solution into 343 uL of Dissection Buffer.
      1. Store on ice.
   5. For RNA isolations, aliquot 1 mL of Trizol into a nuclease free microfuge tube per experimental group. Store on ice. 
   6. For microbial DNA isolations, aliquot 1 mL of sterile/nuclease free ddH20 into a nuclease free microfuge tube per experimental group. Store on ice. 

2. Prepare the following: 
   1. **M9 bath.** 2 mL of M9 in a 35 mm petri dish. Add 100 uL of working BSA solution to M9 to prevent worms from sticking.
   1. **Dissection bath.** 2 mL of Dissection Buffer in a 35 mm petri dish. Add 100 uL of working BSA solution to Dissection Buffer to prevent worms from sticking.
   1. **Dissection array.** In the first well of the 2-well concavity slide, add 150 uL of working Levamisole solution. Also, add in 20 uL of working BSA solution to prevent worms from sticking to the well. In the second well, add 150 uL of Dissection Buffer. Then, add in 20 uL of working BSA solution. 

3. Using a worm pick, move 10 worms from your experimental group of interest off their plate and into the M9 bath. This will remove some external bacteria. 

4. Further rinse the worms by transferring the 10 worms from the M9 bath to the Dissection Buffer bath using a worm pick. 

NOTE: Make up separate M9 and DB baths for each experimental group!

5. Transfer 5 worms from the Dissection Buffer bath to well 1 (Levamisole solution) of the 2-well concavity slide. Once worms are briefly exposed to Levamisole solution, quickly move them into the concavity well containing Dissection buffer (well 2). You don’t want worms to be overly paralyzed when dissecting them, you want them wiggling a bit. 

6. Immediately prior to dissection, add 50 uL of Chelation Buffer to the dissection buffer well containing worms (well 2). This will help maintain RNA integrity during the dissection process. 

7. Dissect all worms. 
   1. For dissections, split your worms into 2 groups. For the first group, use the hypodermic needle to make a cut just behind the pharynx. This will release the anterior to mid-section of the intestine. For the second group, make a cut just in front of the rectum. This will release the posterior to mid-section of the intestine.

NOTE: replace the dissection needle every 10 worms or so, or when observed to go dull! 

8. Give the intestines time to extrude by incubating worms for about 1 min. 

9. Use a microcapillary pipette (i.e., 50 or 100 um) to further help liberate the intestines from the carcass and gonad. Also use the needle to cut away any additional carcass and gonad.  

10. Once intestine sections have been isolated, transfer them (individually) into the microfuge tube containing either TRIzol or sterile/nuclease free ddH20 using the microcapillary pipette. Take care not to lose the intestine by sucking it up completely. Store sample on ice. 

11. Now add the next 5 worms and repeat. 

NOTE: Clean and replace the Dissection Buffer bath reagents every 10 worms! 

12. Keep adding intestine sections from the same experimental group/rep to the microfuge tube (pooling them) until all are collected.

13. When done collecting intestines: 
   1. Move samples stored in TRIzol to the -80C freezer for storage or directly into the RNA isolation protocol. 
   1. Move samples stored in sterile ddH20 (Nuclease free) forward to the microbial DNA isolation protocol.
