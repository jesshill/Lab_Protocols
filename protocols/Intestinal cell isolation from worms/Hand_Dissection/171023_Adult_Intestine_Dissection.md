**Adult *C. elegans* Intestine Dissection**

Adapted from the McGhee Lab

1. Pick ~25 adults and drop them into a heat-sealed and DEPC water filled Pasteur pipette
1. Let them settle down slowly to wash off bacteria/agar/etc (it takes about 12 min. if using 5 3/4inch Pasteur pipette)
1. Add 500 uL of **Dissection Buffer** into a small** petri** dish
1. Add worms into dish by breaking sealed end pasture pipette
   1. From McGhee: “I do this once per hour so the worms will never be out of food for longer than that”
1. Prepare dissection dish by treating wells with 20 ng/ul **Acetylated BSA** 
1. Add 142 uL of **Dissection Buffer** and 8 uL of 100 mM **Levamisole** one “dissection” well, and 150 uL of Dissection Buffer to three additional “washing” wells
1. Put 7 worms into “dissection” well and start timer
1. Cut worms open using 25G needl; first in front of the rectum, followed by a cut just behind the pharynx. 
1. After 10 minutes have elapsed, add 50ul of **Stopping Mix** to the first “dissection” well to stop S7 (this magically lifts the guts off the glass so they don’t really stick anymore) 
1. ` `Wash dissected guts ONE AT A TIME through the series of 3 Buffer B filled wells. Rinse each gut 3 times, back and forth, in each well but
   1. From McGhee: “Don’t let it settle to the bottom… or you’ll feel sorry…it will stick to it!”
1. After final wash transfer intestine to DEPC water rinsed, RNAse free, 0.5ml eppendorf tube sitting on ice (use a tiny glass vial if guts will be used for protein isolation). 
1. Vortex and freeze at -80<sup>0</sup>C.

**Shelton’s medium** (stays good for 1 – 2 months with high variability. Store at 4 C)

1. 1 ml of 5 mg/ml Inulin (from Dahlia tubers. Store at room temp. Heat if crystals precipitated)
1. 50 mg Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) powder (stored at room temp)
1. 100 ul BME vitamins (Gibco BRL).
1. 100 ul Chemically defined lipid concentrate (Gibco BRL)
1. 100 ul Concentrated Pen-Strep 100x (Gibco BRL)
1. 9 ml Drosophila Schneider’s medium (Gibco BRL)
1. 5.3 ml Heat-treated Fetal Calf Serum (FCS) to roughly 35 %. (Gibco, PAA, and Fisher have been used in the past with success).

**Heat Treated Fetal Calf Serum (FCS)**

- Heat at 56 C for 30 min – 2 hrs.
- Aliquot into 5.3 ml aliquots.
- Freeze at -20 C.

**Complete Cell Culture Medium**

Complete cell culture medium (500 ml) contains 500 ml L-15 culture medium from Gibco, 50 ml Fetal Bovine Serum (heat inactivated), 7.7 g sucrose (45 mOsm), 5 ml of 100 U/ml Penicillin and of 100 μg/ml Streptomycin (2%). The complete medium is then filtered using a 0.20 μm pore filter.
