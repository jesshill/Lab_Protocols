**GUTS DISSECTIONS**

Let the glp-4(bn2) hermaphrodites lay eggs onto unseeded plates (20 each?) first thing in the  morning. Remove adults 1 hr later and incubate the plates at 25<sup>0</sup>C. Chunk each plate into 4 at ~ 9pm same day, onto fresh OP50 plate and incubate at 25<sup>0</sup>C for 3 days (dissecting them 60-70 hrs past L1)

When ready to dissect, first clean the bench and microscope with RNAse  ZAP wipes. Only then pick about 25(?) adults and drop them into a heat-sealed and DEPC water filled Pasteur pipette. Let them settle down slowly to wash off bacteria/agar/etc (it takes about 12 min. if using 5 3/4inch Pasteur pipette). Cut off the sealed end and put it “upside down” into 500ul of buffer B in a 4 well tissue culture dish to let the worms crawl out.  I do this once per hour so the worms will never be out of food for longer than that. 

Dissect the guts in 9 well glass dishes, 7 worms at a time. One glass dish works perfect for two rounds of dissections. Treat the wells with 20ng/ul of acetylated BSA.  Put 50ul of diluted S7 into 2 corner wells (diagonally opposite to each other) and add 142ul of Buffer B and 8 ul of 100mM levamisole. Add 400ul of Buffer B to the rest of wells (they will serve as washing buffers. I use center well for rinsing my capillary if needed).

Put 7 worms into first “levamisole” well, start the timer and cut them open using 25G needle, first in front of the rectum, followed by a cut just behind the pharynx. Transfer another 7 worms into the second “levamisole” well and do the same. After the first 10 min. add 50ul of Mix 2 to the first “levamisole” well to stop S7 (this magically lifts the guts off the glass so they don’t really stick anymore) and start washing them ONE AT A TIME  through the series of 3 Buffer B filled wells. Rinse each gut 3 times, back and forth, in each well but don’t let it settle to the bottom… or you’ll feel sorry…it will stick to it!  After final wash  transfer it to DEPC water rinsed, RNAse free,0.5ml eppendorf tube sitting on ice (use a tiny glass vial if guts will be used for protein isolation). Twice a day remove most of excess buffer from the collected guts and add TRIZOL with beta-mercaptoethanol  (0.2ul of beta-mercaptoethanol in 30ul of Trizol). Vortex and freeze at -80<sup>0</sup>C.

The guts are dissected in **Buffer B** (undiluted egg salts) =1 x egg salts + 25mM HEPES i.e. 2mM both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>

40 ml **buffer B** made fresh every day

` `39 ml 1 x egg salts (with Ca<sup>2+</sup>)

1 ml 1M HEPES pH7.4 


**1xEGG SALTS  ( 1L )**

118mM  NaCl**       6.9g

48mM  KCl             3.6g

2mM CaCl<sub>2</sub><sup>.</sup>2H<sub>2</sub>0   0.29g

2mM MgCl<sub>2</sub><sup>.</sup>6H<sub>2</sub>0  0.4g 

Dissolve in 1 L water, add 1 ml DEPC. Let sit in the fume hood O/N and autoclave.  


Addition of 50ul stopping mix **MIX2** to 200ul dissected guts will make final concentration:

2mM x 200ul/250ul + 2mM x 36.5ul/250ul = 1.89mM  (both Ca<sup>2+</sup>and Mg<sup>2+</sup> )


Add EGTA to final 2.5mM:

6\.25 ul of 100mM EGTA (this will chealate all 1.89mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 0.61mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and leave  1.28mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>free. To bring Mg<sup>2+</sup> back to final 4mM need to add 2.72 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> i.e. 1.28mM+100mMx6.8 ul/250ul=4mM

Therefore for the 50ul stopping **MIX2**:

6\.25ul 100 mM EGTA

6\.8ul 100 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>

0\.5 ul RNasin

36\.5ul  Buffer B

**S7 micrococcal nuclease** 

I did** a pilot experiment once again, digesting 200 ng RNA, now in bufferB.

I need 0.05U of S7 to completely digest 200ng of RNA.

7 worms have approximately 7 x 4ng = 28 ng, round it off to 50ng total.

If I need        200ng in 500 ul – 0.05U

Therefore        50ng in 200 ul - 0.0125U (and I need that much in 50ul)

Add 1ul of 0.15U/ul into 600ul of Buffer B and use 50ul of that at a time.
