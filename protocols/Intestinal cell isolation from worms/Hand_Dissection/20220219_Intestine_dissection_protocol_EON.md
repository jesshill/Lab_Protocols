### Protocol
1. Prepare the following buffers on the day of the dissection:
   1. 50 ul acetylated BSA in ddH2O diluted in 1000 ul H2O
   1. Dissection Buffer: 
      4.875 ml of Egg Salts
      125 ul M HEPES, pH 7.4
   1. Levamisole solution (I make 3x tubes of this for 3x isolation batches, more if necessary)
      8 ul of 100 mM levamisole
      142 ul dissection buffer
   1. Chelation buffer (I make 3x tubes of this for 3x isolation batches, more if necessary)
      36.5 ul dissection buffer
      6.2 ul 100 mM EGTA
      5.8 ul 100 mM MgCl2
      4 ul RNAsin (this should probably be changed to 4 ul to account for 200 ul total volume)
2. Prepare the following
   1. **M9 bath.** 2 ml of M9 in a X cm petri dish.
   1. **Dissection bath.** 2 ml of Dissection Buffer in an X cm petri dish
   1. **Dissection array.** Treat each well of a glass, 9-well dissection dish with acetylated BSA by pipetting in 100 ul of 20 ng/ul Acetylated BSA, and then discarding it. This will keep the glass from becoming too sticky. In Well 1, add levamisole soln. In Wells 2 - 4, add 150 ul of Dissection buffer as these will be washing wells.
   1. **Dissection needles.** Ensure you have enough dissection needles and a mouth pipet
3. Using a worm pick, pick ~20 young adult stage worms off a plate and liberate them into the M9 bath. This will remove some *E. coli* bacteria.
4. To further rinse worms, transfer them from the M9 bath to the Dissection bath using a worm picker.
5. Transfer the worms from the Dissection bath to Well 1 of the glass, arrayed dissecting dish. This will incubate the worms in Levamisole, temporarily paralyzing them.
6. Once worms stop moving, dissect them by cutting the worms open using a 26G 5/8” needle. Make the first cut just in front of the rectum and the second cut just behind the pharynx. In some worms, the intestine will spill out of the worm.
7. Incubate 5 – 10 minutes to let the intestines spill out.
8. Add 50 ul of Chelation Buffer to float the carcasses off the glass.
9. Using a micro-capillary needle and a mouth pipet, work to move the worms in and out of the needle to further liberate the intestine from the carcass.
10. Once the intestine has been extruded, pull the intestine into the needle but leave the carcass behind. Use the 26G hypodermic needle to slide the carcass away from the intestine.
11. Transfer the intestine to Well 2, a washing well. 
12. Before the intestine sinks to the bottom of the well, move it to Well 3 using the micro-capillary needle & mouth pipet.
13. Repeat, moving the intestine to Well 4.
14. After the final wash, transfer the intestine to DEPC water for freezing or directly into Trizol.
