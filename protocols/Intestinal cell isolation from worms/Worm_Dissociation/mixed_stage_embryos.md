### <ins> PROTOCOL <ins>
- Prepare OP50 seeded NGM plates
- Grow mixed stage culture of the sorting strain:
  - Chunk a small plate of JM149 worms onto 5 large plates, with the worm covered surface facing down.
  - Then grow worms at 20째C for 72-96 hours, until the E. coli lawn is exhausted.
- Expand mixed stage cultures for cell sorting:
  - Harvest the mixed stage worm population from the 5 plates by washing each plate with 10 mL of M9
  - Transfer the worm suspensions to a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube
  - Pellet the worms by centrifuging for 1 min at 2,000 rcf and aspirate off supernatant 
  - Wash with additional M9 by resuspending the worms in fresh M9 to a total volume of 10 mL
  - Repeat the M9 wash until the supernatant is clear
  - Aspirate supernatant down to about 1 mL, then pipette mix and equally spot worm suspension onto 10 large plates (or more as needed). DONT OVERSEED THE PLATES! 
  - Incubate for 72 hours in a 20째C incubator, until there is a large number of gravid adults
- First embryo synchronization with bleaching solution:
  - Chunk one recently starved small N2 plate onto two large NGM OP50 plates. This is key step, and will serve as the negative GFP control for cell sorting.
  - Harvest mixed stage sorting strain worms from all large plates by washing each plate individually with about 10 ml of M9
    - Transfer mixed stage worm suspension to a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube
    - Pellet the worms by centrifuging for 1 minute at 2,000 rcf
    - Aspirate the supernatant
    - Harvest worms from another plate as outlined above, and add to the same conical tube
  - Once all plates have been harvested, continue washing the worm pellet with fresh M9 to remove excess E. coli by pelleting and resuspending in fresh M9. The final worm pellet yield should be 1 to 2 ml
  - Once the worm suspension is free of E. coli, centrifuge again and remove all M9 supernatant from the worm pellet
  - Resuspend the worm pellet in 8 mL of H2O
  - Add 0.9 mL of Sodium Hypochlorite Solution (Ricca Chemical, 7495.7-32) and 1.44 mL of 5N NaOH to the worm suspension
  - Resuspend the worm pellet with brief vigorous vortexing
  - Incubate at room temperature for 6 to 8 minutes. While incubating shake the tube or place on a nutator. The time to bleach the worms depends on the worm pellet volume, with larger worm pellets taking longer. Do not incubate for longer than 8 minutes.
  - Monitor the progression of the hypochlorite treatment. Larval worms should dissolve, adult worms will begin to break at the vulva and release embryos. I typically monitor the treatment by looking through the tube under a dissection microscope. Aliquots of the worm suspension can also be taken throughout the process and viewed on a microscope slide.
  - Once the worms are sufficiently dissolved, centrifuge the tube for 30 seconds at 2,000 rcf
  - Aspirate the supernatant and wash the embryo pellet by adding 15 ml of M9 to quench the hypochlorite treatment
  - Wash the bleached embryos a second time. Centrifuge the tube for 30 seconds at 2,000 rcf to pellet the embryo suspension. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the embryo pellet in 15 ml of M9.
  - Wash the bleached embryos a third time. Centrifuge the tube for 30 seconds at 2,000 rcf to pellet the embryo suspension. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the embryo pellet in 15 ml of M9.
  - Measure the approximate concentration of embryos in suspension
    - Shake or vortex the tube to ensure the embryos are evenly distributed in the suspension
    - Aspirate 2 ul of embryo suspension with a p10 pipette. Pipette the embryo suspension up and down at least four times before moving on.
    - Dispense the embryo suspension on a clean microscope slide
    - With a cell counter, count the number of embryos on the slide under a dissection microscope. Dilute the embryo suspension if there are too many to count. See step 18.5 for the formula to determine the embryo concentration.
  - Seed 20 large NGM/OP50 plates with 5,000 embryos. Incubate at 20째C for approximately 72 hours until worms are gravid.
- Second embryo synchronization with bleaching solution:
  - Harvest both synchronized sorting strain worms and mixed stage N2 worms in parallel by washing individual plates with ~10 ml of M9 and collecting in two separate 15 ml tubes
  - Transfer the worm suspension to a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube
  - Pellet the worms by centrifuging for 1 minute at 2,000 rcf
  - Discard the supernatant
  - Resuspend the worm pellet with worm suspension from another large plate
  - Repeat this process until worms have been harvested from all large plates for the sorting strain and the N2 plates
  - Once all plates have been harvested, continue washing the worm pellet with fresh M9 to remove excess E. coli. The final worm pellet yield for the sorting strain should be 1 to 2 ml.
  - Once the worm suspension is free of E. coli, centrifuge again and remove all M9 supernatant from the worm pellet
  - Resuspend the worm pellet in 8 ml of H2O
  - Add 0.9 ml of Sodium Hypochlorite Solution (Ricca Chemical, 7495.7-32) and 1.44 ml of 5N NaOH to the worm suspension
  - Resuspend the worm pellet with brief vigorous vortexing
  - Incubate at room temperature for 6 to 8 minutes. While incubating shake the tube or place on a nutator. The time to bleach the worms depends on the worm pellet volume, with larger worm pellets taking longer. Do not incubate for longer than 8 minutes.
  - Monitor the progression of the hypochlorite treatment. Larval worms should dissolve, adult worms will begin to break at the vulva and release embryos. I typically monitor the treatment by looking through the tube under a dissection microscope. Aliquots of the worm suspension can also be taken throughout the process and viewed on a microscope slide.
  - Once the worms are sufficiently dissolved, centrifuge the tube for 30 seconds at 2,000 rcf
  - Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the embryo pellet in 15 ml of M9 to quench the hypochlorite treatment
  - Wash the bleached embryos a second time. Centrifuge the tube for 30 seconds at 2,000 rcf to pellet the embryo suspension. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the embryo pellet in 15 ml of M9.
  - Wash the bleached embryos a third time. Centrifuge the tube for 30 seconds at 2,000 rcf to pellet the embryo suspension. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the embryo pellet in 15 ml of M9.
  - The final embryo yield should be approximately 0.01 ml for the wildtype N2 stain and 0.2ml for the uorescent sorting strain.
