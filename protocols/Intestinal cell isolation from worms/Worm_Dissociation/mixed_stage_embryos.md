### <ins> PROTOCOL <ins>
- Prepare OP50 seeded NGM plates
- Grow mixed stage culture of the sorting strain:
  - Chunk a small plate of JM149 worms onto 5 large plates, with the worm covered surface facing down.
  - Then grow worms at 20°C for 72-96 hours, until the E. coli lawn is exhausted.
- Expand mixed stage cultures for cell sorting:
  - Harvest the mixed stage worm population from the 5 plates by washing each plate with 10 mL of M9
  - Transfer the worm suspensions to a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube
  - Pellet the worms by centrifuging for 1 min at 2,000 rcf and aspirate off supernatant 
  - Wash with additional M9 by resuspending the worms in fresh M9 to a total volume of 10 mL
  - Repeat the M9 wash until the supernatant is clear
  - Aspirate supernatant down to about 1 mL, then pipette mix and equally spot worm suspension onto 20 large plates (or more as needed). DONT OVERSEED THE PLATES! 
  - Incubate for 72 hours in a 20°C incubator, until there is a large number of gravid adults
- First embryo synchronization with bleaching solution:
  - Chunk one recently starved small N2 plate onto 5 large NGM OP50 plates. This is key step, and will serve as the negative GFP control for cell sorting.
  - Harvest mixed stage sorting strain worms from all large plates by washing each plate individually with about 10 ml of M9
    - Transfer mixed stage worm suspension to a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube
    - Pellet the worms by centrifuging for 1 minute at 2,000 rcf
    - Aspirate the supernatant
    - Harvest worms from another plate as outlined above, and add to the same conical tube
  - Once all plates have been harvested, continue washing the worm pellet with fresh M9 to remove excess E. coli by pelleting and resuspending in fresh M9. The final worm pellet yield should be 1 to 2 ml
  - Once the worm suspension is free of E. coli, centrifuge again and remove all M9 supernatant from the worm pellet
  - Resuspend the worm pellet in 8 mL of H2O
  - Add 0.9 mL of Sodium Hypochlorite Solution (Ricca Chemical, 7495.7-32) and 1.44 mL of 5N NaOH to the worm suspension
  - Resuspend the worm pellet with brief vigorous vortexing
  - Incubate at room temperature for 6 to 8 minutes. While incubating shake the tube or place on a nutator. The time to bleach the worms depends on the worm pellet volume, with larger worm pellets taking longer. Do not incubate for longer than 8 minutes.
  - Monitor the progression of the hypochlorite treatment. Larval worms should dissolve, adult worms will begin to break at the vulva and release embryos. I typically monitor the treatment by looking through the tube under a dissection microscope. Aliquots of the worm suspension can also be taken throughout the process and viewed on a microscope slide.
  - Once the worms are sufficiently dissolved, centrifuge the tube for 30 seconds at 2,000 rcf
  - Aspirate the supernatant and wash the embryo pellet by adding 15 ml of M9 to quench the hypochlorite treatment
  - Wash the bleached embryos a second time. Centrifuge the tube for 30 seconds at 2,000 rcf to pellet the embryo suspension. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the embryo pellet in 15 ml of M9.
  - Wash the bleached embryos a third time. Centrifuge the tube for 30 seconds at 2,000 rcf to pellet the embryo suspension. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the embryo pellet in 15 ml of M9.
  - Measure the approximate concentration of embryos in suspension
    - Shake or vortex the tube to ensure the embryos are evenly distributed in the suspension
    - Aspirate 2 ul of embryo suspension with a p10 pipette. Pipette the embryo suspension up and down at least four times before moving on.
    - Dispense the embryo suspension on a clean microscope slide
    - With a cell counter, count the number of embryos on the slide under a dissection microscope. Dilute the embryo suspension if there are too many to count. See step 18.5 for the formula to determine the embryo concentration.
  - Seed 20 large NGM/OP50 plates with 5,000 embryos. Incubate at 20°C for approximately 72 hours until worms are gravid.
- Second embryo synchronization with bleaching solution:
  - Harvest both synchronized sorting strain worms and mixed stage N2 worms in parallel by washing individual plates with ~10 ml of M9 and collecting in two separate 15 ml tubes
  - Transfer the worm suspension to a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube
  - Pellet the worms by centrifuging for 1 minute at 2,000 rcf
  - Discard the supernatant
  - Resuspend the worm pellet with worm suspension from another large plate
  - Repeat this process until worms have been harvested from all large plates for the sorting strain and the N2 plates
  - Once all plates have been harvested, continue washing the worm pellet with fresh M9 to remove excess E. coli. The final worm pellet yield for the sorting strain should be 1 to 2 ml.
  - Once the worm suspension is free of E. coli, centrifuge again and remove all M9 supernatant from the worm pellet
  - Resuspend the worm pellet in 8 ml of H2O
  - Add 0.9 ml of Sodium Hypochlorite Solution (Ricca Chemical, 7495.7-32) and 1.44 ml of 5N NaOH to the worm suspension
  - Resuspend the worm pellet with brief vigorous vortexing
  - Incubate at room temperature for 6 to 8 minutes. While incubating shake the tube or place on a nutator. The time to bleach the worms depends on the worm pellet volume, with larger worm pellets taking longer. Do not incubate for longer than 8 minutes.
  - Monitor the progression of the hypochlorite treatment. Larval worms should dissolve, adult worms will begin to break at the vulva and release embryos. I typically monitor the treatment by looking through the tube under a dissection microscope. Aliquots of the worm suspension can also be taken throughout the process and viewed on a microscope slide.
  - Once the worms are sufficiently dissolved, centrifuge the tube for 30 seconds at 2,000 rcf
  - Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the embryo pellet in 15 ml of M9 to quench the hypochlorite treatment
  - Wash the bleached embryos a second time. Centrifuge the tube for 30 seconds at 2,000 rcf to pellet the embryo suspension. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the embryo pellet in 15 ml of M9.
  - Wash the bleached embryos a third time. Centrifuge the tube for 30 seconds at 2,000 rcf to pellet the embryo suspension. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the embryo pellet in 15 ml of M9.
  - The final embryo yield should be approximately 0.01 ml for the wildtype N2 stain and 0.2ml for the fluorescent sorting strain.
- Now move on to embryo dissociation for FACS enrichment. Before beginning, prepare reagents in advance:
  - L15-10 Buffer:
    - Mix 500 ml Leibovitz's L-15 Medium, 50 ml Fetal Bovine Serum (heat inactivated), 50 ul of 100x Penicillin-Streptomycin solution and 7.7 g sucrose. Filter with 0.2 micron pore lter. Store at 4ºC.
  - Egg Buffer:
    - Mix 29.5 ml of 2M NaCl, 12 ml of 2M KCl, 1 ml of 1M CaCl2, 1 ml of MgCl2, 12.5 ml of 1M HEPES-NaOH pH 7.2 and 435 ml molecular grade water. Filter with 0.2 micron pore lter. Store at 4ºC.
  - Chitinase solution (1 U/ml):
    - Dissolve 5 units of Chitinase from Streptomyces griseus (Sigma C6137-5UN) in 5 ml of Egg Buffer. Nutate the solution for approximately 10 minutes until dissolved. Prepare 1 ml aliquots in 1.5 ml tubes. Store aliquots at -20ºC.
  - Pronase E solution (15 mg/ml):
    - Weigh 150 mg of Protease from Streptomyces griseus (Sigma P8811-1G) into a 15 ml tube. Dissolve the enzyme in 10 ml of Egg Buffer. Nutate the solution for approximately 10 minutes until dissolved. Prepare 1 ml aliquots in 1.5 ml tubes. Store aliquots at -20ºC.
  - On day of protocol:
    - Cool swinging bucket centrifuge to 4ºC
    - Thaw pronase and chitinase aliquots at room temperature
    - Place L15-10 and egg buffer on ice
  - Starting material:
    - Worm suspension in 15 ml tube (material generated from
    - Strains: N2, fluorescent sorting strain
    - Perform this protocol on both strains in parallel
    - Note: The volumes for enzymatic treatments in this protocol require an embryo pellet less than 200 uL. If embryo pellet exceeds 200 ul, utilize 2x the embryo pellet volume.
- Chitinase treatment
  - Centrifuge embryo suspension at 2000 rcf for 1 minute in swinging bucket centrifuge, then aspirate supernatant. 
  - Resuspend the embryo pellet in 1 ml of M9 and transfer to a 1.5 ml tube.
  - Pellet the embryos at 2000 rcf for 1 minute in a centrifuge, then aspirate and discard the supernatant. 
  - Resuspend the embryo pellet in 0.5 ml egg buffer and 1 ml chitinase (1 U/ml)
  - Incubate for 20 min rotating/nutating at room temperature
  - Verify eggshell digestion by visualizing the chitinase treated embryos under a microscope. Early embryos should change shape, and pretzel stage embryos should release from their eggshell.
  - Pellet the embryos at 200 rcf for 5 min in fixed angle rotor centrifuge
  - Aspirate and discard the supernatant
- Pronase treatment and dissociation
  - Resuspend the chitinase treated embryo pellet in 200 ul pronase (15 mg/ml) and 500 ul egg buffer
  - Attach a 21 guage 1¼ inch needle to a sterile 1 ml syringe
  - Disrupt the embryo vitelline membrane and release cells by passing the embryo suspension through the needle 100 times, generating a worm slurry
  - Visually confirm embryo dissociation by viewing a 2 ul sample of worm slurry on a fluorescent microscope
  - Quench the pronase treatment by adding 800 ul of L15-10 media to worm slurry
  - Store the sample on ice until all strains are completed
- Wash and harvest single cells
  - Wash away excess pronase from the worm slurry
    - Pellet the worm slurry at 500 rcf for 5 mins in swinging bucket centrifuge cooled to 4ºC. Aspirate and discard the supernatant.
    - Resuspend the worm slurry in 1 ml of L15-10 media.
    - Pellet the worm slurry at 500 rcf for 5 mins in swinging bucket centrifuge cooled to 4ºC. Aspirate and discard the supernatant.
    - Resuspend the worm slurry in 1 ml of L15-10 media.
  - Harvest the cells
    - Pellet undissociated embryos at 100 rcf for 1 minute in swinging bucket centrifuge cooled to 4ºC
      - NOTES:
        - This step will separate the dissociated cells from intact embryos
        - Cells will remain in the supernatant
        - Ensure your cell type of interest is not lost during this step.
        - Visually confirm fluorescent cells are present in the supernatant.
        - Visually confirm fluorescent cells are not present in the pellet.
        - You may need to reduce the centrifuge speed and/or time if fluorescent cells are in the pellet of this step.
    - Aspirate 1 ml of the cell-containing supernatant. Keep the pipette away from the pelleted worm debris.
    - Dispense the cell suspension though a 35-micron nylon mesh filter into a 5 ml flow cytometry tube
  - Perform an additional round of cell harvest for the sorting strain only.
    - Total cell suspension volumes:
      - Control strain = 1ml
      - Sorting strain = 2ml
- Measure approximate cell concentration
  - Load 10 ul of cell suspension to a Bio-Rad TC20 automated cell counting slide
  - This protocol should yield between 2 to 4x10^6 cells
  - Dilute the sample to 1x10^6 cells/mL if above this concentration with L15-10
    - Cell suspensions exceeding this concentration may increase the probability of doublets and/or clogging the machine. 
  - Microscopically confirm fluorescent cells are present in the cell suspension
- Now prepare cells for FACS:
  - Embryo stage cell prep
    - Divide samples into flow tubes with the following volumes and labels
      - Sample type; worm strain; dye; cell volume
        - unstained control; N2; none; 0.5 mL
        - GFP single color control; GFP strain; none; 0.5 mL
        - PI single color control; N2; Propidium Iodide; 0.5 mL
        - sorting sample; GFP strain; Propidium Iodide; 2-4 mL
      - To the appropriate tubes, add two drops of ReadyFlow Propidium Iodide per 1x10^6 cells/mL
      - Incubate for 15 mins on ice protected from light
- Proceed to FACS machine and setup
  - The following protocol steps were developed on a BD FACSAria III instrument. The settings and recommendations detailed here may be adjusted as necessary.
  - Instrument setup:
    - Set laser gain and area scaling factor on the FACS instrument to ensure that collected data falls within the plotting area.
    - Set plots to log-log axis
      - NOTE: C. elegans cells are smaller than material typically run on a FACS instrument. Compared to mammalian cell lines, C. elegans cells require a lower area scaling factor and lower laser voltages.
  - Run the unstained control sample through the FACS instrument. Adjust laser voltages and area scaling factors to ensure that collected data (i.e. SSC and FSC) falls within the plotting area. Once values are set properly, record data from ~10,000 events
  - Run single color control samples through the FACS instrument and record data from ~10,000 events. Set gates based on single color controls.
  - Run the sorting sample through the FACS instrument and record data from ~10,000 events
  - Verify that gates are set appropriately for the sorting sample and adjust gates as needed
- Sort cells
  - Once gates and gating strategy are established, prepare either 2 flow tubes (for bulk RNA-seq) or a v-bottom 96 well plate (for scRNA-seq) to collect the sorted cells. If performing bulk RNA-seq, aliquot 0.2 ml of L15-10 into the 2 flow tubes first! Place the tubes/or plate into the collection holder inside the FACS instrument.
  - Prepare the FACS instrument for collection of cells from the "nonintestine cells" gate and "intestine cells" gate
  - Collect 1x10^6 cells from the non-intestine cells gate. This should yield a total volume of 3.5 - 4 ml of cell suspension. Store sorted cells on ice.
  - Collect cells from the "intestine cells" gate continuously until there is no more sorting sample remaining. This should yield between 50,000 to 300,000 cells in a total volume of 0.2-0.5 ml. Store sorted cells on ice.
- Post-sort purity analysis
  - Once sorting is complete, perform a post-sort purity analysis. This will determine if the FACS run was successful.
  - The microfluidic line must be cleaned after sorting and before measuring post-sort purity for each sample. Clean the line by running a sample of fresh 10% bleach for ~5 mins. Follow this by running a sample of filtered H20 ~2 mins. The FACS instrument should record fewer than 1 event/sec if it is clean.
  - Run the intestine cell sample back through the instrument. The intestine cell post-sort purity should be 80-90%.
  - Clean the microfluidic line following the procedure. Run the non-intestine cell sample back through the instrument. The non-intestine cell post-sort purity should be 100%.
- Now move to next downstream assay (i.e., RNA-seq, scRNA-seq)
