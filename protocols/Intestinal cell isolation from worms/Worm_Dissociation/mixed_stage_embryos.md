### <ins> MATERIALS <ins>

#### STRAINS USED: 
- E. coli OP50
- JM149
  - FACS sorting strain
  - Single color control for GFP
- N2
  - FACS unstained control
  - Also use for other single color controls (i.e. live/dead staining)

#### REAGENTS: 
- LB broth mix (Genessee 11-120)
- M9 Buffer (1 L)
  - 3 g KH2PO4 (Sigma-Aldrich P0662)
  - 6 g Na2HPO4 (Thermo Fisher S373)
  - 5 g NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich S9888)
  - 1 mL 1 M MgSO4 (Sigma-Aldrich 208094)
  - Add ddH20 up to 1 L 
- NGM plates (1 L)
  - 3 g NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich S9888)
  - 17 g agar (Genesee 20-249)
  - 2.5 g peptone (VWR 89406-350)
  - Add 975 mL of ddH2O to bring up to 1 L
  - 1 mL 1M CaCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich C3306)
  - 1 mL 5 mg/mL cholesterol (Fisher 501848291)
  - 1 mL 1M MgSO4 (Sigma-Aldrich 208094)
  - 25 mL 1M KPO4 Buffer pH 6.0 (108.3 g KH2PO4, 35.6 g K2HPO4, H2O to 1 L) (Sigma-Aldrich P0662, P3786)
  - complete protocol:http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_strainmaintain/strainmaintain.html#d0e214
- Peptone enriched NGM: in recipe above use 20 g peptone instead of 2.5 g peptone
- Bleaching solution:
  - Sodium Hypochlorite Solution, 6% available chlorine (Ricca Chemical, 7495.7-32)
  - 5 N NaOH (Fisher S318-100)
    
#### CONSUMABLES: 
- 150 mm petri dishes "large plates" (Corning 351058)
- 15 mL centrifuge tubes (Peak PS-695)

#### EQUIPMENT:
- Swinging bucket rotor refrigerated centrifuge (Eppendorf 5810R)
- Pipet-Aid (VWR 89166-464)
- 20Â°C incubator (Caron 7001-28-1)

### <ins> PROTOCOL <ins>
- Prepare OP50 seeded NGM plates
- Grow mixed stage culture of the sorting strain:
  - Chunk a small plate of JM149 worms onto 5 large plates, with the worm covered surface facing down.
  - Then grow worms at 20C for 72-96 hours, until the E. coli lawn is exhausted.  
- Expand mixed stage cultures for cell sorting:
  - Harvest the mixed stage worm population from the 5 plates by washing each plate with ~10 mL of M9
  - Transfer the worm suspension to a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube
  - Pellet the worms by centrifuging for 1 min at 2,000 rcf and aspirate off supernatant 
  - Wash with additional M9 by resuspending the worms in fresh M9 to a total volume of 10 mL
  - Repeat the M9 wash until the supernatant is clear
  - Aspirate supernatant down to about 1 mL, then pipette mix and equally spot
