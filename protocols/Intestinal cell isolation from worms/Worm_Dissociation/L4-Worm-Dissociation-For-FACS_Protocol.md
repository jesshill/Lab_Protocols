**miRNeasy Micro RNA Isolation Protocol**

(200112\_miRNeasy\_Micro\_RNA\_Isolation.docx)


**PURPOSE:** For purification of total RNA, including miRNA, from animal and human cells and tissues

**STARTING MATERIAL:** No more than 5 mg of animal cells or tissue.

**CAUTION:** DO NOT add bleach or acidic solutions directly to the sample-preparation waste.

Both QIAzol Lysis Reagent and Buffer RWT contain guanidine thiocyanate, which can form highly reactive compounds when combined with bleach. QIAzol Lysis Reagent contains phenol and guanidine thiocyanate which are toxic and corrosive. 

**BEFORE STARTING:** 

- Buffers RWT and RPE are supplied as concentrates. Before using for the first time, add the required volumes of ethanol (96–100%), as indicated on the bottle, to obtain a working solution.
- Prepare 80% ethanol with ethanol (96–100%) and RNase-free water.

**NOTES:**

RNeasy MinElute spin column specifications 

Maximum binding capacity: 45 µg 

RNA Maximum loading volume: 700 µl 

RNA size distribution: RNA >18 nucleotides approximately 

Minimum elution volume: 10 µl 

Maximum amount of starting material: 5 mg

RNA ISOLATION

1. Cool centrifuge to 4°C
1. Disrupt the cells through 3 rounds of freeze-thaw using liquid nitrogen. Thaw cells by placing tubes in bead bath at 37°C or by leaving out at RT (25°C).
1. For samples extracted in 700 uL of QIAzol, add 140 µL of phenol:chloroform to the tube containing the homogenate and cap it securely. Vortex the tube vigorously for 15 s. 
   1. Otherwise, add 200 uL of chloroform per 1 mL of QIAzol.
1. Place the tube containing the homogenate on the benchtop at RT for 2–3 min.
1. Centrifuge for 15 min at 10,000 x g at 4°C. 
   1. After centrifugation, the sample separates into 3 phases: an upper, colorless, aqueous phase containing RNA; a white interphase; and a lower, red, organic phase. 
   1. The volume of the aqueous phase should be approximately 350 µL.
1. Transfer the upper aqueous phase to a new collection tube with lid. Add 1.5 volumes of 100% ethanol and mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down several times. Do not centrifuge. **Continue without delay to the next step.**
1. Pipet up to 700 µL of the sample, including any precipitate that may have formed, into an RNeasy MinElute spin column in a 2 mL collection tube (supplied, kept at 4°C). Close the lid gently and centrifuge at ≥8000 x g for 30 s at RT (25°C). Discard the flow-through.

**Note:** Do not discard any of the following flowthroughs in a liquid waste vessel that contains bleach

1. Add the remainder of the sample into the RNeasy MinElute spin column, and centrifuge at ≥8000 x g for 30 s at RT. Discard the flowthrough.
1. ***Skip this step if performing on column digestion:*** Add 700 uL Buffer RWT to the RNeasy MinElute spin column. Centrifuge at ≥8000 x g for 30 s at RT. Discard the flow-through. 
1. ` `On Column DNase digestion for samples containing <1 μg
   1. Pipette 350 μL Buffer RWT (prepared with isopropanol) into the RNeasy MinElute spin column and centrifuge for 30 s at ≥8000 x g to wash. Discard the flow-through.
   1. In a separate tube, add 10 μL DNase I stock solution to 70 μL Buffer RDD per RNA isolation. Mix by gently inverting the tube. Do not vortex.
   1. Pipet the DNase I incubation mix (80 μL) directly onto the RNeasy MinElute spin column membrane and place on the benchtop at 20– 30°C for 15 min.
      1. Make sure to pipet the DNase I incubation mix directly onto the RNeasy membrane. DNase digestion will be incomplete if part of the mix sticks to the walls or the O-ring of the RNeasy MinElute spin column.
   1. Pipette 500 μL Buffer RWT (prepared with isopropanol) into the RNeasy
   1. MinElute spin column and centrifuge for 30 s at ≥8000 x g. **Keep the flow-through.**
   1. Reapply the flow-through to the RNeasy MinElute spin column and centrifuge for 30 s at ≥8000 x g. Discard the flow-through.
1. Pipette 500 µL Buffer RPE onto the RNeasy MinElute spin column. Close the lid gently and centrifuge for 30 s at ≥8000 x g to wash the column. Discard the flow-through.
1. Pipette 500 µL of 80% ethanol onto the RNeasy MinElute spin column. Close the lid gently and centrifuge for 2 min at ≥8000 x g to wash the spin column membrane. Discard the collection tube with the flow-through.
   1. After centrifugation, carefully remove the RNeasy MinElute spin column from the collection tube so that the column does not contact the flow-through. Otherwise, carryover of ethanol will occur.
1. Place the RNeasy MinElute spin column into a new 2 mL collection tube (supplied). Open the lid of the spin column, and centrifuge at full speed for 5 min to dry the membrane. Discard the collection tube with the flow-through.
   1. To avoid damage to their lids, place the spin columns into the centrifuge with at least one empty position between columns. Orient the lids so that they point in a direction opposite to the rotation of the rotor (e.g., if the rotor rotates clockwise, orient the lids counterclockwise).
   1. It is important to dry the spin column membrane since residual ethanol may interfere with downstream reactions. Centrifugation with the lids open ensures that no ethanol is carried over during RNA elution
1. Place the RNeasy MinElute spin column in a new 1.5 mL collection tube (supplied). Add 20 µL RNase-free water directly to the center of the spin column membrane. Close the lid gently, and centrifuge for 1 min at full speed to elute the RNA.

RNA QUANTIFICATION

**Qubit:**

Protocol for machine is on card under it, tubes dye and buffer above machine and standards are in door of Rob’s fridge. 

- Make **working solution** of Qubit reagent and Qubit buffer – use broad range reagents (stored at RT above machine).  

\# = number of samples (plus 1 for pipetting error) + 2 standards 

Vol. Qubit Reagent = # \* 1 uL

Vol. Qubit Buffer = # \* 199 uL

- Qubit RNA BR (broad range) Standards (stored at 4C) 
  - Standard 1: catalog/reference number: Q10210 C
  - Standard 2: catalog/reference number: Q10210 D

- Make **standard solutions**: In the Assay Tubes supplied with the Qubit kit, combine 190 uL of working solution with 10 uL of standard 1, and an additional tube with 190 uL working solution and 10 uL standard 2. Clearly mark the lid of each tube.
  - The Qubit light path is horizontal, so label the tops of tubes!
- Make user samples: combine 2 uL of sample with 198 uL of working solution.
- Vortex all tubes for 2-3 seconds
- Incubate the tubes for 2 minutes at room temperature.
- Insert the tubes into the Qubit Flourometer and take readings

**Tapestation:** 

***For High Sensitivity RNA ScreenTape Assay: When sample range is between 500-10,000 pg/uL and 100 – 6000 nt***

High sensitivity RNA screen tape sample buffer catalog number: 5190-6507. The **max range is 10 ng** so will have to dilute samples. 

Stuff in Rob’s fridge door labeled Tapestation RNA sensitivity, 4th floor of Biology

Is an automated electrophoresis solution for the sample quality control of DNA and RNA samples. It is suitable to analyze size, quantity, and integrity of the samples. Look for a 2:1 ratio of 28S to 18S in eukaryotic RNA to determine if intact. 

RNA integrity number (RIN) value is calculated from the overall trace, including degraded products (which is better than just assessing the rRNA peaks alone).   

The sign in for the computer is Admin and password (3000hanover).

- Allow reagents to equilibrate at room temperature for 30 minutes
- Vortex mix before use
- Thaw total RNA samples on ice
  - *Dilute our samples to 5 ng/uL so that we can pipet 2 uL of sample for a total of 10 ng.* 
  - *(1 uL sample)(# ng/uL from Qubit) = (5 ng/uL)(x)* 
- Add 1 uL Sample Buffer to 2 uL RNA sample
- Vortex using IKA vortexer and adaptor at 2000 rpm for 1 min
- Spin down to position the sample at the bottom of the tube
- Denature samples
  - Head samples to 72 °C for 3 min
  - Place samples on ice for 2 min
- Centrifuge and collect samples in the base of the tubes
- Carefully remove cap, do not disturb sample
- Place tube strip into Tapestation, and start run
  - Use a full strip of tubes in the machine, even if not using all tubes. This will prevent single tubes or short stripes from being sucked up by the machine.
- Prepare Tapestation. Turn on the tapestation and launch the Agilent 2200 Tapestation software.
- Load RNA ScreenTape (barcode facing away from tips) and loading tips into 2200 Tapestation.
- Select Eukaryotic RNA protocol
