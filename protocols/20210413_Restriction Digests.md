Digests are highly variable in terms of reaction setup. However, there are a few key questions to answer when setting up a reaction:

- What is the final product that you will be making?
- Which plasmid are you using as a substrate?
  - How much plasmid will you need to digest?
- What enzyme do you need to use?
  - Where are you cutting the plasmid?
  - Do you need to use two enzymes?
  - How long will your enzyme need to digest?
  - What is the optimal temperature for your enzyme?
- How will you inactivate the restriction enzymes?
  - Can they be heat inactivated?
  - Will you column purify?
  - Do you need to gel purify?
- What buffer conditions will be necessary?
  - Do the enzymes work in cutsmart?
  - What concentrations of each component will you need?
- What product size do/would you expect if you ran the reaction on an agarose gel?
- What percentage of agarose should you use?
  - For short DNA, use a higher agarose concentration à reduced pore size
  - For long DNA, use a lower agarose concentration à increased pore size 
  - Don’t forget to use the same buffer to fill the gel box as you did to prepare the gel. 
- Should you use TBE or TAE buffer for gel electrophoresis?
  - TBE buffer is less prone to overheating and is better for longer electrophoresis runs. 
- How long should you run your gel?
  - Run at between 80-150V
  - Run the gel until the visible dye is about 75% of the way down. 
  - Usually takes around 1-1.5 hours, depending on the size of your gel and the percentage of agarose used. 
  - Typical: load around 100 – 150 ng of DNA/well and run at 100V for 1.5 hrs
