### **Methods**

1. Add 250 mL S Medium to a sterilized 1-2 liter flask.
1. Inoculate the S Medium with a concentrated *E. coli* OP50 pellet made from 2-3 liters of an overnight culture.
1. Wash each of 4 large plates of *C. elegans* (just cleared of bacteria) with 5 ml S Medium and add to the 250 ml flask.
1. Put the flask on a shaker at 20°C. Use fairly vigorous shaking so that the culture is well oxygenated.
1. Cultures should be monitored by checking a drop of the culture under the microscope. If the food supply is depleted (the solution is no longer visibly cloudy) add more concentrated *E. coli* OP50 suspended in S Medium. When there are many adult animals in each drop, the culture is ready to be harvested. This is usually on the 4<sup>th</sup>or 5<sup>th</sup> day.
1. Put the flask on ice for 15 minutes to allow the worms to settle.
1. Aspirate most of the liquid from the flask.
1. Transfer the remaining liquid to a 50 ml sterile conical centrifuge tube and spin for at least 2 min at 1150 × g to pellet the worms. Young larvae may take longer than 2 min to pellet.
1. Aspirate the remaining liquid.

The worms harvested from growth in liquid culture are usually longer and thinner than those grown on petri plates, and tend to hold their eggs. The number of adults, larvae and eggs obtained depends on the strain of worms used, the amount of bacteria provided and the length of time the culture is grown. Freshly cleared cultures will yield worms equal to half the weight of the bacteria used ([Lewis and Fleming, 1995](http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_strainmaintain/strainmaintain.html#bib7)).
