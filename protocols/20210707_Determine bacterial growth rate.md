**Determine bacterial growth rate**

**Protocol**

**Day 1:**

- Streak bacteria fresh from glycerol stock onto LB agar plate and grow up overnight at the desired temperature. 

**Day 2:**

- Pick a single colony and inoculate a 10 mL culture of sterile LB. 
- Incubate overnight at the desired temperature. 

**Day 3:**

- Take 1 mL of the overnight liquid culture and use it to inoculate 9 mL’s of fresh, sterile LB broth. 
- Take an OD600 at zero hour.
- Then incubate at the desired temperature for the desired period of time. 
- At each desired time interval (i.e., 30 min, 1 hr, etc.) take a 1 mL aliquot of the culture and read the OD600. 
- Graph the absorbance values at OD600 (log scale, log 1.5 or 2) as a function of time (linear scale).
  - There is no zero-point on the log scale, as that means there are no cells to begin with.
  - There is a zero-point on the time scale (T<sub>0</sub>).
- Bacterial generation time can be determined by extrapolation from the growth curve.
