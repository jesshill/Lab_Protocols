**This protocol serves as a more efficient alternative to making males than heat treatment in a water bath.** 


1) Make fresh a solution of 7% ethanol in M9 (700 uL of 100% ethanol in 9.3 mL of M9).

1) Pick mid to late L4 stage hermaphrodites onto an NGM/OP50 plate. As many as you want to attempt to make males.

1) Add ~1 – 1.5 mL of 7% ethanol solution to the plate. Make sure the plate surface is completely covered. 

1) Place the worm plate into a box and incubate the worm for 30 min in the 25C incubator.

1) Post-incubation, pick worms out of the ethanol solution and onto a fresh NGM/OP50 plate. One worm per plate. 

1) Now, put the worms back into 20C incubator and watch for males over the next 3 – 4 days.
