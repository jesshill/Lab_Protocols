### PURPOSE: 
RNA interference, or RNAi, is a technique in which double stranded RNA is introduced to an organism, resulting in targeted gene silencing (knock down). We can induce RNAi in _C. elegans_ by first preparing plates with _E. coli_ that express target gene dsRNA, which the worms will eat. Then, 4th larval stage worms are transferred to the RNAi plates and allowed to lay eggs. At the desired stage of development the progeny are collected and scored for phenotypes.

dsRNA enters _C. elegans_ tissue once ingested. Inside the cell, the enzyme Dicer cleaves the double stranded RNA into short interfering RNA, or siRNA, which is between 21 and 23 nucleotides long. Next, the siRNA associates with the RNA induced silencing complex, also known as "RISC", and becomes unwound. Then, the siRNA/RISC complex binds the target mRNA via complementary base pairing. This leads to the degradation of the mRNA, thereby knocking down that gene.

RNAi feeding libraries use the _E. coli_ strain HT115 (DE3), which contains an isopropyl beta-D-1-thigalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible T7 polymerase site to promote the production of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (so a genetic fragment from both the 5' and 3' ends are produced).

  - Suggested final concentration is 1 mM. 


### PLATE PREPERATION: 
minimum sterilization times for liquid cycle:
- 20 min cycle for < 500 mL
- 40 min cycle for 500 mL - 1 L
- 60 min cycle for > 1 L


<ins> NGM+Carb+IPTG Plates (1 L)

- Mix the following reagents:
  - 3 g NaCl
  - 2.5 g Bacto Peptone
  - 17 g Bacto Agar
  - Add water to 975 mL
- Add a stir bar   
- Autoclave for 40 minutes to sterilize
- Cool media to about 50 – 65 C (the flask glass should be touchable)
- Using sterile technique, add:
  - 1 mL 5 mg/mL Cholesterol
  - 1 mL 1 M CaCl2
  - 1 mL 1 M MgSO4
  - 25 mL 1 M Potassium Phosphate Solution (pH 6)
  - 1 mL 1 M Nystatin (anti-fungal solution)
  - 1 mL 50 mg/mL Carbenicillin
  - 1 mL 1 M IPTG
- Once all ingredients have been added, stir media thoroughly and then pour plates.
- Store plates at 4C for about a month. 


### BACTERIAL PREPERATION: 

<ins> Obtain _E. coli_ RNAi feeding strains

- Streak out strains from the _E. coli_ feeding collection onto LB Carb [100 ug/mL] plates. Grow at 37C over night.
- Store resulting single colonies in a personal -80C glycerol stock for future reference.
- Sequence the resulting vectors to ensure the appropriate transcript will be targeted.
- Stock streak plates of _E. coli_ can be stored at 4C for 4–6 wk after which time, a fresh batch from the -80C is recommended for best dsRNA activity.

<ins> Grow up _E. coli_ RNAi feeding strains for seeding

- Start overnight liquid cultures for all RNAi strains of interest, by innoculating ___________mL of LB supplimented with 50 ug/mL Carb.
  - Question specific RNAi strain(s)
    - query strain(s) _____________________________________________________________________________
    - additional control(s) for query strain(s) ___________________________________________________
  - Postitive control
    - _pop-1_ RNAi is a standard positive control that should produce 100% embryonic lethality.
  - Negative control
    - Empty vector (L4440) is a common negative control that should result in a 0 % embryonic lethality.
- Grow at 37C while shaking (200 RPM).
- Next day, pellet cultures (3000 RPM, 10 min, RT) and aspirate supernatanet to concentrate bacteria 10x.
  - For example, 50 mL overnight culutre will be brought down to 5 mL.
  - For example, 10 mL overnight culutre will be brought down to 1 mL. 
- Seed concentrated RNAi strains onto RNAi plates.
  - Need to seed only 1 mL of each strain onto an RNAi plate.
    - Can make 5 query plates, and 1 control plate.
- Can use plates immediatly or let dry and then store at 4C for 1 month.

**ALTERNATIVE APPROACH:** 
- Grow up RNAi strain(s) in 10 mL of liquid culture (LB supplemented with 50 or 100 ug/mL Carb) overnight at 37C and shaking.
- Next day (no more than 18 hrs after innoculation), dilute the overnight culture(s) by adding 40 mL of fresh LB supplemented with 50 or 100 ug/mL Carb and grow at 37C for 3 more hours.
- Then, induce dsRNA transcription by adding IPTG to culture(s) to a final concentration of 1 mM. Put back in incubator for another 3 hours.
- 3 hours after dsRNA induction, plate RNAi strain(s) onto RNAi plates.
- Can use immediatly or let dry overnight.
  - Store plates up to 2 weeks at 4C!


### PROTOCOL:

<ins> Worm growth and embryo harvest
  - Grow ____________ worms on OP50 plates until they are gravid.
    - Need 1 large plate for each RNAi strain, including controls, so at least a total of 3 large plates (RNAi of interest, POP-1 positive control, L4440 negative control). 
  - Embryo prep worms
    - If the RNAi strain is larvel lethal, then let embryos hatch overnight in M9 and seed onto OP50 plates until they reach the L3 stage. Then wash worms 2 times with M9 and seed onto RNAi plates of interest for about 48 hrs (enough time to develop and lay eggs). 
      - Alternatively, could just grow in liquid OP50 (waste less plates) until the L3 stage.
    - If the RNAi strain is not larvel letahl, then seed embryos directly onto RNAi plates.
- Harvest RNAi treated worms at desired stage for downstream analysis.
