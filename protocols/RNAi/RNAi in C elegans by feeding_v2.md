# RNA interference in _C. elegans_ by feeding

### PURPOSE: 
RNA interference, or RNAi, is a technique in which double stranded RNA is introduced to an organism, resulting in targeted gene silencing (knock down). We can induce RNAi in _C. elegans_ by first preparing plates with _E. coli_ that express target gene dsRNA, which the worms will eat. Then, 4th larval stage worms are transferred to the RNAi plates and allowed to lay eggs. At the desired stage of development the progeny are collected and scored for phenotypes.

dsRNA enters _C. elegans_ tissue once ingested. Inside the cell, the enzyme Dicer cleaves the double stranded RNA into short interfering RNA, or siRNA, which is between 21 and 23 nucleotides long. Next, the siRNA associates with the RNA induced silencing complex, also known as "RISC", and becomes unwound. Then, the siRNA/RISC complex binds the target mRNA via complementary base pairing. This leads to the degradation of the mRNA, thereby knocking down that gene.

RNAi feeding libraries use the _E. coli_ strain HT115 (DE3), which contains an isopropyl beta-D-1-thigalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible T7 polymerase site to promote the production of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (so a genetic fragment from both the 5' and 3' ends are produced).

- 60 min cycle for > 1 L


<ins> NGM+Carb+IPTG Plates (1 L)

  - 3 g NaCl
  - 2.5 g Bacto Peptone
  - 17 g Bacto Agar
  - Add water to 975 mL
- Add a stir bar   
- Autoclave for 40 minutes to sterilize
- Cool media to about 50 – 65 C (the flask glass should be touchable)
- Using sterile technique, add:
  - 1 mL 5 mg/mL Cholesterol
  - 1 mL 1 M CaCl2
  - 1 mL 1 M MgSO4
  - 25 mL 1 M Potassium Phosphate Solution (pH 6)
  - 1 mL 1 M Nystatin (anti-fungal solution)
  - 1 mL 50 mg/mL Carbenicillin
  - 1 mL 1 M IPTG
- Once all ingredients have been added, stir media thoroughly and then pour plates.
- Store plates at 4C for about a month. 

### BACTERIAL PREPERATION: 

<ins> Obtain _E. coli_ RNAi feeding strains

- Streak out strains from the _E. coli_ feeding collection onto LB Carb [100 ug/mL] plates. Grow at 37C over night.
- Store resulting single colonies in a personal -80C stock for future reference.
- Sequence the resulting vectors to ensure the appropriate transcript will be targeted.
- Stock plates of _E. coli_ can be stored at 4C for 4–6 wk after which time, a fresh batch from the -80C is recommended for best dsRNA activity.



- Start overnight liquid cultures for all RNAi strains of interest, by innoculating ___________mL of LB supplimented with 50 ug/mL Carb.
  - Question specific RNAi strain(s)
    - query strain(s) _____________________________________________________________________________
    - additional control(s) for query strain(s) ___________________________________________________
  - Postitive control
    - _pop-1_ RNAi is a standard positive control that should produce 100% embryonic lethality.
  - Negative control
    - Empty vector (L4440) is a common negative control that should result in a 0 % embryonic lethality.
- Grow at 37C while shaking (200 RPM).
- Next day, pellet cultures (3000 RPM, 10 min, RT) and aspirate supernatanet to concentrate bacteria 10x.
  - For example, 50 mL overnight culutre will be brought down to 5 mL.
  - For example, 10 mL overnight culutre will be brought down to 1 mL. 
- Seed concentrated RNAi strains onto RNAi plates.
  - Need to seed only 1 mL of each strain onto an RNAi plate.
    - Can make 5 query plates, and 1 control plate.
- Can use plates immediatly or let dry and then store at 4C for 1 month. 

### PROTOCOL:

<ins> Worm growth and embryo harvest
  - Grow __________ worms on OP50 plates until they are gravid.
    - Need 1 large plate for each RNAi strain, including controls, so at least a total of 3 large plates (RNAi of interest, POP-1 positive control, L4440 negative control). 
  - Embryo prep worms
    - If the RNAi strain is larvel lethal, then let embryos hatch overnight in M9 and seed onto OP50 plates until they reach the L4 stage.
      - Alternatively, could just grow in liquid OP50 (waste less plates).
    - If the RNAi strain is not larvel letahl, then seed embryos directly onto RNAi plates. 










2. Grow and Induce _E. coli_

<ins> DAY 1 <ins>

- Inoculate 5 mL of liquid LB Carb [100 ug/mL] with each _E. coli_ strain. Repeat for all strains needed, including controls.
- Grow overnight at 37 C, shaking (200 RPM).

<ins> DAY 2 <ins>

- No more than 18 hr after initial _E. coli_ inoculation dilute overnight cultures. Add 40 uL of each overnight culture into 6 mL fresh LB Carb [100 ug/mL].
- Grow shaking at 37C for 3 hours.                      
- Induce dsRNA transcription by adding IPTG to 1 mM final concentration to each culture.
- Organize 6 cm RNAi plates by labeling them.
- Add IPTG to 1 mM final concentration per plate (use calculation above).
- 3 hours after _E. coli_ induction, plate 500 ul of each culture on a 6 cm RNAi plate.
- Let plates dry overnight at room temp.

<ins> DAY 3 <ins>

\*Store plates up to 2 weeks at 4 C or use immediately in step 3.

3. Move worms onto _E. coli_ seeded plates

<ins> DAY 3 or LATER <ins>

- Move 1 – 2 worms onto an _E. coli_ seeded plate. L4 worms can be used or very young adult worms.
- This step can be optimized in a variety of ways. N2 worms or RNAi sensitive worms can be used. The age of the worm can be optimized for each transcript. Just try to stay consistent with the age of each worm added within a given experiment.
- Allow worms to grow on plates for 24 hours at 20 C.

4. Capture laid eggs

<ins> DAY 4 <ins>

- 24 hours after first _E. coli_ exposure, obtain freshly laid eggs by moving worms to a new _E. coli_\-seeded plate (of the same dsRNA expression). This is called the “24 hr. Capture Plate”.
- Let the worms lay on the capture plate for 2 hrs – 24 hours depending on their egg-laying rate. Try to capture at least 50 eggs.
- Move worms to a new plate (of the same dsRNA type) and return to 20 C. Count the eggs on the capture plate.

5. Measure embryonic viability.

<ins> DAY 5 <ins>

- 24 hours after the adult worms were moved off of the capture plate, count the # embryos and # hatched worms.
- Compare the total numbers with the number embryos counted the day before.
- If there are discrepancies, look for dead worms on the lip of the plate and try to count those.
- If counting is challenging, count each plate twice.
- Tabulate numbers both 1) by hand in the lab notebook and 2) in excel spreadsheet form.
- Calculate the % viability and % lethality for each strain.

<ins> 48 – hour time point <ins>

- In addition, a 48 hour time point is often useful. Start another capture plate for 48 hours after first _E. coli_ exposure and repeat the embryonic viability calculation.

UPDATES TO THE PROTOCOL:

Hi Erin,


The few changes to the original protocol were made from recommendations from the Ahringer lab’s currect protocol. The main differences are some concentrations and choices of antibiotic. The major change is the top spreading of Carb/IPTG; also IPTG is not added to liquid culture.

1.       Grow E.coli in 100 mg/L Carb LB liquid overnight.

2.       Inoculate 6 mL fresh LB-Carb with 40 ul of overnight culture.

3.       Grow fresh LB Carb for 6 hours shaking at 37C

4.       Top spread NGM plates with 100 mg/L Carb and 1 M IPTG. I premix 1:1 solution of our Carb and IPTG stocks then pipette 1ul Carb-IPTG mix per 1 ml medium. Assuming 6 cm plates are 12.5 mL and 10 cm plates at 25 mL total. Spread with the L-shaped glass pipette, with ethanol/flaming in between.

5.       Briefly let the 25-50 uL of topspread Carb-IPTG mix soak in.

6.       Seed plates with 500-1000 ul 6 hour culture.

7.       Allow plates to dry and induce overnight.

8.       Store at 4 degrees.
