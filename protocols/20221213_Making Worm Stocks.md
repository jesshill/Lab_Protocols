**SOLUTIONS**

- S Buffer (autoclave or sterile filter): 
  - 1 L
    - 129 mL of 0.05 M K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> (MW: 174.18 g/mol)
    - 871 mL of 0.05 M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (MW: 136.08 g/mol)
    - 5.85 g of NaCl
  - 0.1 L
    - 12.9 mL of 0.05 M K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>
    - 87.1 mL of 0.05 M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
    - 0.5844 g of NaCl

- S Buffer + 30% glycerin (v/v) (autoclave or sterile filter)


**PROCEDURE**

1. Use 1 large, 2-3 medium, or 5-6 small NGM plates that have lots of freshly starved L1-L2 animals. 
1. Wash the plate(s) with 0.6 mL S Buffer for each vial you will freeze. 
   1. Make around 5 cryovials per strain. Will unthaw 1 tube the next day to verify that cryopreservation worked. 
   1. For 5 cryovials, need 3 mL of S Buffer
1. Collect worms into a 15 mL conical tube.
1. Add an equal volume of S Buffer + 30% glycerin (aka glycerol) and pipette mix.
1. Aliquot 1.0 mL of mixture into cryovials labelled with the strain name and date. 
1. Pack the cryovials in an isopropanol freezer container (Mr. Frosty). 
   1. Make sure the Mr. Frosty is at RT prior to packing in the cryovials. 
1. Place the Mr. Frosty in the −80°C freezer overnight (or for at least 12 hours).
1. The next day transfer the vials to their permanent freezer locations. Thaw one vial as a tester to check how well the worms survived the freezing process.
