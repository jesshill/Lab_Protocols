**smFISH Ordering Information**

` `To order Stellaris Biosearch smFISH Probes:

1) go to the Biosearch webpage

1) Log into Biosearch webpage with our lab account

1) Navigate to the Stellaris Probe Designer

1) Design your probe
   1. Make sure your probes have names like oEON### 
      1. Where o = oligo, EON = Your initials, and ### is a unique number identifier.
   1. Set organism to C. elegans
   1. Start with default settings for masking, probe length, number of probes
   1. Add your target sequence and search.
   1. Select the fluorophore you want for the 5’ and 3’ modification.
   1. repeat for all your probes.

1) IMPORTANT -- Copy and paste all information on your probe sequences. For some reason it's really hard to get this information again after you place the order and we need these sequences for publication. Save these sequences somewhere safe.

1) When probes arrive, dilute to 25 uM in 10 mM Tris pH 8.0 (this is a dilute tris solution also called "T no E". Make a few aliquots so you don't need to thaw the stock solution each time.


1) Add your probe set to your appropriate inventory sheet. 

For FLAP probe design through Stellaris Biosearch: 

1) Go to custom oligo synthesis, and select configure oligos in tubes
1) Go to order now
1) Input your oligo name (i.e., FLAPX, or FLAPY)
1) Choose your 5’ and 3’ modification (the fluorophore you would like your FLAP to have).
1) Put in the reverse compliment for the FLAP sequence you are building this for (i.e. X, Y, or Z).
1) Then choose the purification, and oligo scale.
   1. The company recommends Dual HPLC for purification of dual labeled probes in the colors we like.
