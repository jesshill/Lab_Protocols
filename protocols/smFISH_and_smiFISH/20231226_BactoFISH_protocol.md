**NEEDED REAGENTS AND SOLUTIONS**

Wash Buffer A (10% v/v formamide)

- Make fresh for each experiment. 
- Make up 3 mL for each sample to be hybridized. Combine reagents into a nuclease free tube and vortex to mix. 
  - 200 uL x3 600 uL Wash Buffer A (Biosearch Technologies; Cat#: SMF-WA1-60) 
  - 0.7 mL x3 2.1 mL DEPC water
  - 100 uL x3 300 uL Deionized Formamide 



In fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the addition of formamide to aqueous buffers solutions of DNA enables key procedural steps—such as the prehybridization denaturation, the reannealing step and the post-hybridization stringency washes—to be carried out at lower, less harsh temperatures without compromising the overall efficiency and specificity of the hybridization.

Wash Buffer B

- Make sure water has been added to Wash Buffer B before use (Biosearch Technologies; Cat#: SMF-WB1-20) 

Hybridization Buffer (10% v/v formamide)

- Prepare 110 uL for each sample to be hybridized
- Buffer should be mixed fresh for each experiment
- For a final volume of 110 uL, mix 99 µL of Stellaris RNA FISH Hybridization Buffer (Biosearch Technologies; Cat#: SMF-HB1-10) with 11 µL Deionized Formamide. 

*Do not freeze Hybridization Buffer.*

Methanol and Acetone

- Have room temperature regents available for fixing samples.

Mounting Medium (5 mL)

- 2.5 mL of 100% glycerol
- 25 mg of N-propyl gallate\*
- 100 uL of 1M Tris (pH 8.0)
- 2.4 mL of DEPC H<sub>2</sub>0

Updated Mounting Medium (3 mL)

- 2.5 mL of 100% glycerol
- 100 mg of N-propyl gallate\*
- 400 uL of 1M Tris (pH 8.0)


*\*Add N-propyl gallate last*

- Vortex until completely dissolved.
- Minimize exposure to light (N-propyl gallate is light sensitive).
- Prepare 1 mL aliquots in dark tubes or tubes wrapped in foil.
- Store at 4°C or -20°C.
- When medium turns yellow and begins crystalizing make fresh* 


**PROTOCOL**

1. Grow worms until the desired developmental stage. 
1. Harvest worms by washing them off plates with M9 and collecting them into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
1. Pellet sample (2000g, 30 sec), then rotate 180 degrees and re-pellet. Aspirate supernatant and discard. 
1. Resuspend in 1 mL of M9 to wash. Then pellet and aspirate supernatant. 
   1. Repeat wash until supernatant is clear.
1. Fix the sample by adding 1 mL of methanol, then vortexing. Incubate for 5 min at RT while nutating. Then pellet the sample and remove the fixative. Immediately add 1 mL of acetone and then vortex. Incubate for 5 min at RT while nutating. Finally, pellet the sample and remove the fixative.
1. Wash sample by adding 1 mL Wash Buffer A. Lightly vortex, then pellet and remove supernatant.
   1. Repeat wash for a second time. Then pellet and remove supernatant. 

Hybridize smFISH probes

1. Prepare 110 uL of hybridization solution for sample. 
1. Prepare a 1:20 dilution of the 25 uM smFISH probe in DEPC water. Final concentration of the probe will now be 1.25 uM. 

*We purchase smFISH probes at 5 nmol and then dilute them to 25 uM when they arrive.* 

1. Add 2 uL of diluted smFISH probe to hybridization solution. Vortex well, it is viscous.
   1. If probing for more than 1 transcript, just add the additional 2 uL of probe to the hybridization solution. 

*Treat annealed smiFISH probes as diluted smFISH probes. 2 uL of annealed smiFISH probes work well for most hybridizations.* 

*smiFISH probes can be used in combination with traditional smFISH probes.*

1. Add 100 uL hybridization solution containing probes to the pelleted sample. 
1. Hybridize overnight at 37°C in the dark while shaking (1000 rpm). 

Wash and Image

- Next day, add 1 mL of Wash Buffer A directly to the hybridized sample. 
- Incubate at 37°C for 30 min with shaking (1000 rpm). 
- Pellet sample (2000g, 30 sec), then rotate 180 degrees and re-pellet. Aspirate supernatant and discard.

OPTIONAL: Add 1 mL of Wash Buffer A plus DAPI (5 mg/mL) to the sample. Incubate at 37°C for 30 min with shaking (1000 rpm). Centrifuge sample (2000g, 30 sec), then rotate 180 degrees and re-pellet. Aspirate supernatant and discard.

- Add 1 mL of Wash Buffer B to sample and vortex. Incubate for 5 min at 37°C with shaking (1000 rpm).
- Pellet sample (2000g, 30 sec), then rotate 180 degrees and re-pellet. Aspirate supernatant and discard.
- Resuspend sample in 50 uL of mounting medium (or less depending on your sample density). Let the sample sit (protected from light) for between 10 – 30 min before moving on, to let the antifade permeate the cells. Can sit out at room temp. 
  - NEED to incubate for 30 min when using the 670 fluor.

Mount on slides

**Version A**

- Working at a dissecting scope, drop 2 – 6 uL of sample in mounting medium onto a single 8 mm 1.5 thickness round cover glass (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Cat#: 72296-08).
- Add the same volume of VectaShield Diamond anti-fade solution and pipette up and down to mix thoroughly. 
- After pipette mixing, draw off the same volume of VectaShield/sample that was just added. 
- Place a 1.5 thickness 22 mm x 22 mm square coverglass on top trying to avoid bubbles. 

*I do all of this atop a slide so that I can flip the coverglass sandwich over without getting it stuck to the microscope stage.*

- Remove as much liquid as possible from between the two cover glasses using a kimwipe placed up against the round one. The aim is to flatten the sample as much as possible without damaging the embryos/worms. 

*I will often press lightly with a pipette tip at the end to squeeze out that last little bit.*

- Affix the coverglass sandwich to a microscope slide using a Grace Bio-Lab Press-To-Seal silicon isolator (Sigma Aldrich; cat#: GBL664504-25ea) such that the sample will be imaged through the square coverglass.
- Head off to the microscope! 
- Store any un-imaged samples in the dark. Image same day.

**Version B**

- Add 5 uL of VectaShield Diamond anti-fade solution to the center of a microscope slide. 
- Then add 5 uL of sample to the VectaShield.
- Add a square coverslip to the sample.
- Once the coverslip is down and the sample has moved across the coverslip (fully covering), apply Valap sealant or Insta-Dry clear Nail polish.
