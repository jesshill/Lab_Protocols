**NEEDED REAGENTS AND SOLUTIONS**

Wash Buffer A (10% v/v formamide)

- Make fresh for each experiment. 
- Make up 1.5 mL for each sample to be hybridized. Combine reagents into a nuclease free tube and vortex to mix. 
  - 300 uL Wash Buffer A (Biosearch Technologies; Cat#: SMF-WA1-60) 
  - 1.05 mL nuclease free water
  - 150 uL **Deionized** Formamide 
    - There is a difference

In fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the addition of formamide to aqueous buffers solutions of DNA enables key procedural steps—such as the prehybridization denaturation, the reannealing step and the post-hybridization stringency washes—to be carried out at lower, less harsh temperatures without compromising the overall efficiency and specificity of the hybridization.

Wash Buffer B

- Make sure water has been added to Wash Buffer B before use (Biosearch Technologies; Cat#: SMF-WB1-20) 

Hybridization Buffer (10% v/v formamide)

- Prepare 110 uL for each sample to be hybridized
- Buffer should be mixed fresh for each experiment
- For a final volume of 110 uL, mix 99 µL of Stellaris RNA FISH Hybridization Buffer (Biosearch Technologies; Cat#: SMF-HB1-10) with 11 µL Deionized Formamide. 

*Do not freeze Hybridization Buffer.*

Pre-chill Acetone and Methanol 

- Prepare 0.5 mL for each sample.
- Place acetone/methanol in -20C freezer. Allow to cool. 
  1. If time runs out and acetone/methanol is not cool, freeze it quickly in liquid N<sub>2</sub>, allow to thaw, and then place in the -20C freezer.

Mounting Medium (5 mL)

- 2.5 mL of 100% glycerol
- 25 mg of N-propyl gallate\*
- 100 uL of 1M Tris (pH 8.0)
- 2.4 mL of Nuclease-free H<sub>2</sub>0

*\*Add N-propyl gallate last*

- Vortex until completely dissolved.
- Minimize exposure to light (N-propyl gallate is light sensitive).
- Prepare 1 mL aliquots in dark tubes or tubes wrapped in foil.
- Store at 4°C or -20°C.
- When medium turns yellow and begins crystalizing make fresh

smiFISH Probe Preparation 

1. Primary Probes
- Oligos are delivered in 96-well plates diluted in TE buffer to 100 uM
- Prepare equimolar mixture of primary probes and dilute in 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) made with Nuclease-free water until you reach a concentration of 0.833 uM per probe.  
  - Use the smiFISH dilution calculator to make the equimolar mix. 

1. FLAP Preparation
- FLAPS are delivered lyophilized. Resuspend FLAP probes in 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 50 uM. 
- Make 5 uL aliquots and store at -20C in the dark.

1. Pre anneal smiFISH and FLAP probes
- In a PCR tube, prepare solution of:
  - 2 uL of primary probe set (Oligo mixture prepared in “Primary Probe Preparation”)
  - 1 uL 50 uM FLAP 
  - 1 uL NEBuffer 3.1 (New England Bio Labs; Cat#: B7203S)
  - 6 uL Nuclease-free H<sub>2</sub>0
- In thermocycler run solution prepared above at the following:
  - 1 cycle at 85 C for 3 min
  - 1 cycle at 65 C for 3 min
  - 1 cycle at 25 C for 5 min

*You can make up in advance but keep only for one week. If making in advance, rather than the day of, store annealed probes in the freezer protected from light.* 


**PROTOCOL**

Dissection

1. Dissect ~10 ovaries into tubes containing Schneider’s media. Mosquitoes should be blood fed and allowed to lay eggs, so dissection ~3-4 days after a bloodfeed is recommended. Unfed mosquito ovaries can easily be distinguished (much smaller and less developeled) and should be discarded. Mosquito ovaries appear as clusters of grapes. Pure ovaries pellet easier and have much less autofluorescence, but are more likely to be lost during pipetting and harder to distinguish in the tube and on the slide than ovaries with carapace. 
1. If not starting Day 1 within the next 24 hours, place ovaries in the –20C and store until usage.
   1. Thus far, ovaries have all been frozen. We will test fresh ovaries soon. 


Before Starting

1. Book **microscope for desired day and time before doing anything else.**
1. Ensure probes have been pre-annealed before starting day 1, or plan for a time to do this. The hour long ethanol incubation is plenty of time to prepare the probes. 
1. Check quality of mounting media and prepare more if necessary.

Sample Fixation \*this step can be optimized for your specific background strains used in imaging.

1. Place samples in 200 uL of 4% formaldehyde solution for 10 minutes.
1. Wash twice with 200 uL of PBS for 2-5 minutes. 
1. Place sample in 200 uL of ethanol (stored at –20C). Incubate each at room temp for at least one hour, then store in the fridge in ethanol for no more than a week. Warm to room temp before proceeding.
1. Wash twice with 200 uL of PBS for 2-5 minutes. 

Hybridize smiFISH probe

1. Prepare 110 uL of hybridization solution for sample. 
1. Add 2 uL of annealed smiFISH probes to hybridization solution. Vortex well, it is viscous.
   1. If probing for more than 1 transcript, just add the additional 2 uL of probes to the hybridization solution. 

*Treat annealed smiFISH probes as diluted smFISH probes. 2 uL of annealed smiFISH probes work well for most hybridizations.* 

*smiFISH probes can be used in combination with traditional smFISH probes.*

1. Centrifuge sample (14000 xg for 1-2 min) and aspirate off Wash A buffer.
1. Add 100 uL hybridization solution containing probes to the pelleted sample. 
1. Hybridize overnight at 37°C in the dark while shaking (125 rpm). 
   1. For our lab, this is accomplished by putting the tubes in a freezer box and leaving in the culture shaker overnight.
   1. If need to leave samples for longer, up to 3 days of hybridization still works. 

**END DAY ONE**

Wash and Image

- Next day, add 200 uL of Wash Buffer A directly to the hybridized sample. 
- Incubate at 37°C for 30 min with shaking (450 rpm). 
- Centrifuge sample (14000 xg for 1-2 min) and aspirate supernatant.
- Add 200 uL of Wash Buffer A 
  - If not using vectashield with DAPI, add 0.5 uL (or less) of 2 mg/mL DAPI solution to sample. 
- Incubate at 37°C for 30 min with shaking (125 rpm).
- Centrifuge sample (14000 xg for 1-2 min) and aspirate supernatant.
- Add 200 uL of Wash Buffer B to sample. Incubate for 5 min at 37°C with shaking (125 rpm).
- Centrifuge sample (14000 xg for 1-2 min) and aspirate supernatant.
- Resuspend sample in 30 uL of mounting medium (or less depending on your sample density). Let the sample sit (protected from light) for between 10 – 30 min before moving on, to let the antifade permeate the cells. Can sit out at room temp. 
  - NEED to incubate for 30 min when using the 670 fluor.
    - We should probably err on the side of longer with our fluors, but unsure about our specific dyes for now


Mount on slides

- Prepare cut pipette tip to manipulate sample using scissors. This will allow gentler handling of the ovaries. A 20 uL tip cut is recommend, with the cut approximately a third of the way up the tip so 2/3 of the tip is remaining. USE FILTERED TIPS AND NO MORE THAN HALF OF MAXIMUM VOLUME TO AVOID SAMPLE ENTERING PIPETTE
- Re-vortex mounting media before usage to ensure all solid is dissolved.
- Working at a dissecting scope, drop 10 uL of sample in mounting medium onto a single 8 mm 1.5 thickness round cover glass (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Cat#: 72296-08).
- Add the same volume of VectaShield Diamond anti-fade solution and pipette up and down to mix thoroughly. Use an uncut tip for this process to avoid taking up ovaries
  - Be careful with the VectaShield, it is extremely viscious and can become sucked into the pipette. The pipette tips should have filters, and when drawing the pipette out of the media put some slight pressure (as if pipetting out) so the media is not sucked into the top of the pipette and to avoid introducing air bubbles.
- After pipette mixing, draw off the same volume of VectaShield/sample that was just added. 
- Place a 1.5 thickness 22 mm x 22 mm square coverglass on top trying to avoid bubbles. 

*I do all of this atop a slide so that I can flip the coverglass sandwich over without getting it stuck to the microscope stage.*

- Head off to the microscope! 
- Store any un-imaged samples in the dark. Image same day.
  - The samples lose fluorescence quickly, so
