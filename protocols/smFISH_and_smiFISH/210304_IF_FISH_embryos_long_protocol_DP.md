**Immunfluorescence of *C. elegans* embryos in Tubes** 

**Note: PBST = PBS Tween 20 (0.1%)** I haven’t tried 0.05% like some labs use.

1. Collect embryos from gravid worms by hypochlorite treatment. Wash embryos with M9 two times. 
1. Add 1 ml -20°C 100% methanol, vortex, and immediately freeze embryos by dipping tubes in liquid nitrogen for 1 minute. Immediately start spinning tubes at 2000 x RCF as the tube thaws. Once five minutes total have passed remove the methanol and add 1 ml -20°C 100% acetone and fix at -20°C for five more minutes.
1. Remove acetone and wash three times with PBST by rocking for 5 min.
1. Block for 30 min at 37<sup>o</sup> C in PBST containing 1% by weight BSA and 1 unit/ul RNAsin (Promega) (I add the RNAsin prior to the BSA just for safety).
1. Apply 1° antibody solution diluted in PBST with BSA and 1 unit/ul RNAsin. (Note:  I typically add undiluted antibody to ~100-200ul of PBST+BSA depending on the dilution).

1. Incubate for 1-2 hrs at room temperature or overnight at 4˚C.
1. Wash three times in PBST by rocking for 5 min each.
1. Incubate with 2° antibody (diluted in PBST) for 1 hr at room temperature.

1. Wash two times in PBST by rocking for 5 min each followed by two more washes in 2xSSC for 5 minutes each.
1. Wash once in Stellaris Wash Buffer A
1. Add hybridization buffer with 2ul FISH probe and incubate at 37°C overnight.
1. Wash twice in Wash A for 30 minutes at 37°C with the second wash containing DAPI. Wash once in Wash B
1. Mount slides for microscopy with antifade reagent. Leave at room temperature overnight and then seal with nail polish.
