To an Erlenmeyer flask add:  
- 3 g NaCl  
- 17 g agar	
- 2.5 g peptone
- Bring up to 1 L by adding 975 mL of ddH<sub>2</sub>O		

Don’t mix contents. Cover flask with foil, add a strip of autoclave tape, fill autoclave bin with ~1 - 2” of water, and autoclave for 40 min on liquid cycle. Let Erlenmeyer flasks sit in autoclaved bin with water and wait until cool enough to touch. When agar is cool, add the following ingredients (can add in any order):

Using sterile technique, add:           
- 1 mL of 1 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>
- 1 mL of 5 mg/mL cholesterol
- 1 mL of 1 M MgSO<sub>4</sub>
- 25 mL of KPO<sub>4</sub> (pH 6.0)
- 1 mL of 10 mg/mL Nystatin

Swirl to mix (avoiding bubbles). Dawn gloves and then clean hands with ethanol to prevent contamination. Pour plates (avoiding bubbles). Immediately rinse out EFs with hot water so that agar doesn’t solidify on flasks. Let plates solidify/dry for 1 day. Once the plates have solidified, seed with desired bacteria. Once plates are seeded, let dry for 1 – 2 days and store in 4C walk in fridge.
