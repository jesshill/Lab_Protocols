**Isolation of gut bacteria from *C. elegans***


**PROTOCOL**  

For a whole small plate of worms

1. Harvest worms off plate with sterile M9 and transfer to a sterile Eppendorf tube.

1. Pellet (1 min, 2000 g, RT) and remove the supernatant. 

1. Wash worms 4 times with 1 mL of sterile M9. Pellet (1 min, 2000 g, RT) and remove the supernatant in between washes. 

1. After the 4<sup>th</sup> wash, add 1 mL of M9 and let worms nutate at RT for 5 min (to enhance digestion or defecation of any transient gut bacteria). Then pellet (1 min, 2000 g, RT) and remove the supernatant.

1. Bring worms up to 0.2 mL in sterile M9. Then place worms on ice for 10 min to paralyze them. 

1. Surface sterilize worms by adding 3 volumes of 1% bleaching solution and incubate while nutating for 1 min. 

1. Post incubation, immediately pellet (1 min, 2000 g, RT) the sample and remove the supernatant. **(Don’t bleach for longer than 2 min)**

1. Wash worms 2 times with 1 mL of sterile M9. Pellet (1 min, 2000 g, RT) and remove the supernatant in between washes. **However, after the last wash, aspirate** **and save the supernatant for plating to determine the background level of bacteria.** 

1. Resuspend sample in 200 uL of sterile M9 for mortar/pestle lysing. 

1. Lyse worms with a sterilized pestle in the eppi tube. Perform stroke/twists for about 2-3 min. Check the sample under the dissecting scope after 2 min and see if worms are broken up enough.  

1. Plate 100 uL of worm lysate and supernatant onto appropriate plates and spread. Culture plates at the appropriate temperature (i.e. 20C or 37C) and count CFUs the next day (may need to incubate for another day). Also image the plates in the gel imager for CFU counting. 

1. Count plates with between 30 – 300 colonies. Otherwise, plates are Too Few To Count (TFTC) or Too Many To Count (TMTC).  







For individual worms in a well of a 96 well plate

1. Harvest worms off plate with sterile M9 and transfer to a sterile Eppendorf tube.

1. Pellet (1 min, 2000 g, RT) and remove the supernatant. 

1. Wash worms 4 times with 1 mL of sterile M9. Pellet (1 min, 2000 g, RT) and remove the supernatant in between washes. 

1. After the 4<sup>th</sup> wash, add 1 mL of M9 and let worms nutate at RT for 5 min (to enhance digestion or defecation of any transient gut bacteria). Then pellet (1 min, 2000 g, RT) and remove the supernatant.

1. *Levamisole method of paralysis:* 
   1. Paralyze worms by adding 0.2 mL of 10 mM levamisole and confirm with microscopy before moving to the next step. Should take about 3 min. 
      1. Levamisole (MW: 240.75 g/mol) solution should be made in ddH20
   1. Surface sterilize worms by adding 3 volumes of 1% bleaching solution and incubate while nutating for 1 min. 

1. *Cold method of paralysis:* 
   1. Paralyze worms by adding 0.2 mL of M9, then putting the sample tube on ice for 10 min.
   1. Surface sterilize worms by adding 3 volumes of 1% bleaching solution and incubate on ice for 1 min. 

1. Post incubation, immediately pellet (1 min, 2000 g, RT) the sample and remove the supernatant. **(Don’t bleach for longer than 2 min)**

1. Wash worms 2 times with 1 mL of sterile M9. Pellet (1 min, 2000 g, RT) and remove the supernatant in between washes. **However, after the last wash, aspirate** **and save the supernatant for plating to determine the background level of bacteria.** 

1. Resuspend sample in 200 uL of sterile M9, and transfer sample to a small petri dish. 

1. Pick worms off the plate, into individual wells of a clear 96 well plate. 

1. Add … scoop of sterile … glass beads to each well containing a worm. 

1. Disrupt worms, releasing gut bacteria, by bead beating for … min in the IKA vortexer (set to … RPM). 

1. Post vortex, let the beads settle to the bottom of the well. Then transfer fluid (excluding the beads) into new unused wells in the plate. 

1. Take the plate and now move to the plate reader. Read the plate (OD 600nm) every hour over night in the plate reader, set the temperature appropriately.
