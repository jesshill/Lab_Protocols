**Isolation of gut bacteria from *C. elegans***


**Protocol:**  

1. Harvest worms off plates with sterile M9 and transfer to 15 mL conical tube(s). 

1. Pellet (1 min, 2000 g, RT) and remove the supernatant. 

1. Wash worms 5 times with 5 mL of M9. 

1. After final wash, leave worms in 1 mL of M9 for 10 min to enhance digestion or defecation of any transient gut bacteria. 

1. Paralyze worms with 2 volumes (= 2 mL) of 10 mM levamisole and confirm with microscopy before moving to the next step. 

1. Levamisole (MW: 240.75 g/mol) solution should be made in ddH20

1. Surface sterilize worms with 1 volume (= 3 mL) of #% bleaching solution and incubate while nutating for 2 min. 

1. Using a new serological pipette, add 6 mL of M9 to sample to dilute out the bleach and pellet (1 min, 2000 g, RT). 

1. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend in 10 mL of M9. Wash worms for a total of 2 times. 

1. After the last wash, aspirate and save the supernatant for plating to determine the background level of bacteria. Leave about 1 mL of supernatant to allow transfer of 500 uL of sample into eppi tube for mortar/pestle lysing. 

1. Lyse worms with a sterilized pestle in a sterile eppi tube. Perform 200 stroke/twists. 

1. Plate 100 uL of worm lysate and supernatant onto appropriate plates and spread. Culture plates at the appropriate temperature (i.e. 20C or 37C) and count CFUs the next day (may need to incubate for another day). Also image the plates. 

1. Count plates with between 30 – 300 colonies. Otherwise, plates are Too Few To Count (TFTC) or Too Many To Count (TMTC).

For microbe isolation, the respective nematode samples were washed three times in 1 mL M9, then resuspended in 250 μL M9 containing three 1-mm zirconium beads, followed by 2 min vortexing to break up the worms. The environmental samples were taken up in sterile ddH2O and shaken for 1 h to suspend the microbes present. Afterwards, the solid particles in both sample types were pelleted by centrifugation and 100 μL of supernatant in serial dilutions were plated onto 9-cm agar plates containing either diluted trypticase soy agar (TSA, 10 % strength), MacConkey agar, Sabouraud glucose agar, potato dextrose agar, or yeast peptone dextrose agar. Culture plates were incubated at 15 °C, to simulate average temperature conditions in the northern German sites. Single colonies were picked upon appearance and recultured for purification on diluted TSA. For long-term storage, stocks with 30 % glycerol were prepared from fresh liquid cultures in trypticase soy broth (TSB) and stored at −80 °C.

To investigate community assembly in the gut of C. elegans, we fed germ-free synchronized adult worms with different bacterial species, in monoculture or in mixture, over 4 days in a well-mixed rich liquid medium (Methods, Fig. S1A). The majority of worms survived the 4-day period of feeding and colonization, after which we allowed live worms to feed briefly on heat-killed E. coli OP50 to remove transient colonizers [35, 45]. We then cleaned the surface of the worms with consecutive washes, and measured the intestinal bacterial densities by grinding batches of worms, plating, and counting colony forming units (CFU, Fig. S1B) with distinct morphologies [46]. The supernatant of each sample was plated to verify that CFU counts came from the worm digestions instead of the background media (Methods). This protocol allowed us to construct and quantify simple microbiotas in C. elegans

Mechanical disruption of worms and quantification of bacteria 

The worm samples were washed to remove most external bacteria and then incubated in 100 µL S medium + 2X heatkilled OP50 at 25 °C for 1 h to allow the worms to evacuate any non-adhered bacterial cells from the intestine. Worms were then rinsed twice with M9 Buffer, cooled down 15 min at 4 °C to stop peristalsis, and bleached for 6 min at 4 °C with 100 µL M9 Buffer + 0.2% v/v bleach (Clorox). Worms were then rinsed three times with cold M9 Buffer + 0.1% Tx to remove the bleach. 

Manual disruption with a motorized pestle and 96-deepwell plate disruption with silicon carbide grit followed previously described protocols [35]. To guarantee the background media was fully clean, the supernatant in each sample was also collected, serially diluted, and plated onto Nutrient Agar (3 g yeast extract, 5 g peptone, and 15 g of agar [Bacto] in one liter of water). The plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 days to allow distinct colony morphologies to develop, and then the colonies were counted with the aid of a stereo microscope (Leica MZ10 F).

Disruption of worms and plating of intestinal populations 

Colonized worms were washed 1X with M9 worm buffer + 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2X with M9 worm buffer to remove most external bacteria, then resuspended in 100 μL S medium + 1X heat-killed OP50 and incubated at room temperature (23˚C) for 30–60 min to allow the worm to purge any nonadhered bacterial cells from the intestine. Worms were then rinsed 2X with M9 worm buffer + 0.1% Triton X-100, chilled briefly to stop peristalsis, and surface bleached for 10 min at 4˚C in 100 μL M9 worm buffer with commercial bleach at 1:1000 concentration. 

For manual disruption, bleached worms were rinsed 1X in M9 worm buffer + 0.1% Triton X-100 to remove bleach, then transferred to 3 mL M9 worm buffer + 1% Triton X-100 in a small (40 cm) petri dish (Fisher Scientific). Individual worms were pipetted out in 20 μL aliquots of buffer and transferred to 0.5 mL clear microtubes (Kimble Kontes) for manual disruption with a motorized pestle (Kimble Kontes Pellet Pestle with blue disposable pestle tips, Fisher Scientific). Magnification was provided by a magnifying visor (Magni-Focuser Hands Free Binocular Magnifier 3.5X). After disruption, tubes were centrifuged 2 min at 12,000 RPM to collect all material, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 180 μL M9 worm buffer (final volume 200 μL/worm) before transfer to 96-well plates for serial dilution in 1X phosphobuffered saline (PBS). 

For 96-well plate disruption, bleached worms were rinsed 1X in M9 worm buffer + 0.1% Triton X-100 to remove bleach. Worms were then treated for 20 min with 100 μL of a SDS/ DTT solution in M9 worm buffer (0.25% sodium dodecyl sulfate + 3% freshly mixed dithiothrietol, chemicals from Sigma Aldrich), rinsed with 150 μL M9 worm buffer, then rinsed again in 1 mL M9 worm buffer + 0.1% Triton X-100 before transfer to 3 mL M9 worm buffer + 1% Triton X-100 in a small (40 cm) petri dish (Fisher Scientific). A deep-well plate (2 mL square well plate, Axygen) was prepared by addition of a small quantity of a sterile, autoclaved 36-mesh silicon carbide grit (Kramer Industries) to each well, followed by addition of 180 μL M9 worm buffer + 1% Triton X-100. Individual worms were then pipetted out in 20 μL aliquots of buffer and transferred to individual wells of the plate. The plate was covered with parafilm and allowed to chill for at least one hour prior to disruption to reduce heat damage to bacteria. Parafilmed plates were capped with 96-well square silicon sealing mats (Axygen Impermamat AxyMat Sealing Mats) and disrupted by shaking in a 96-well plate shaker (MO-BIO Laboratories, shaking at 30 hz for 1.5 min before flipping plate and shaking an additional 1.5 min to ensure even disruption). Plates were then centrifuged at 2,500 x g for 2 min to collect all material in the bottom of the wells, then all plate contents were resuspended by pipetting and transferred to 96-well plates for serial dilution in PBS.
