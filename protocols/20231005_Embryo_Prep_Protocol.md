**REAGENTS**

M9

ddH<sub>2</sub>0

Bleaching Solution (for multiple samples)	or	Bleach in the tube (single sample)

40 mL of ddH<sub>2</sub>0				8 mL of ddH<sub>2</sub>0

7\.2 mL of 5N NaOH				1.44 mL of 5N NaOH

`             `4.5 mL of 5% NaHOCl                                          0.9 mL of 5% NaHOCl 	

\*Make sure the 5% bleach (kept in the 4C fridge) is brought up to room temp before use. Bleaching temperature affects its activity and changes the duration required to incubate with sample. 

**PROTOCOL**

- Grow worms on OP50 plates until they are gravid (*adult with multiple eggs*).
- Harvest worms by washing them off plates with M9. Collect them into a 15 mL conical tube. Pellet sample (2000 x g, 1 min, RT) and remove supernatant in between additions. 
- Wash sample with 10 mL of M9 until the supernatant is clear (*usually requires 1 - 2 washes*). Pellet sample (2000 x g, 1 min, RT) and remove supernatant in between washes.
- To the sample, add 10 mL of premade bleach solution or prepare the bleach solution in the sample tube. 
- Nutate worms for 8 min at RT. 
  - You should see that embryos are released from their mothers, and carcasses are fairly degraded (*adult parts broken into about 2 pieces but no more*).  
  - Take care not to overbleach your sample though, as this will damage early-stage embryos (*i.e., 2 cell stage*). Worms should not be in bleach solution for more than 9 min. 
- Post bleaching, immediately pellet sample (2000 x g, 1 min, RT) and remove the supernatant. 
- Wash sample 3 times with 10 mL of M9. Pellet sample (2000 x g, 1 min, RT) and remove supernatant in between washes. 
- Resuspend sample in 10 mL of M9. Then check the sample under the dissecting scope.
  - Should see lots of embryos and shouldn’t see a lot of intact carcasses. 
- Next steps:
  - If letting the embryos hatch in M9 overnight, place the sample on the nutator at either 25C or 20C.
  - If planning to do FISH, then move to the FISH protocol.
