### Protocol

1. Inoculate 10 ml of LB with DH5a from a frozen stock or colony. Grow overnight.
2. Inoculate 1 L of LB in a 2 L flask with the 10 ml overnight culture.  Make sure to save some LB for a blank. Grow until OD<sub>595</sub> is 0.5-1.0 (about 3-6 hours).
3. Pellet in two 500 ml sterile bottles at 3000g for 15 min at 4<sup>o</sup>C.
4. Rinse each pellet in 500 ml sterile ice cold water.  Shake vigorously and pipette to resuspend.
5. Pellet at 3000g for 10 min at 4<sup>o</sup>C.
6. Resuspend each pellet in 250 ml sterile ice cold water.  Combine into one bottle.
7. Pellet at 3000g for 10 min at 4<sup>o</sup>C.
8. Resuspend pellet in 500 ml sterile ice cold water.
9. Pellet at 3000g for 10 min at 4<sup>o</sup>C.
10. Resuspend the pellet in 50 ml sterile ice cold water.  Transfer to a 50 ml tube.
11. Pellet at 3000g for 10 min at 4<sup>o</sup>C.
12. Remove all the supernatant.  Resuspend the pellet in 2 ml sterile ice cold 10% glycerol.  The final volume is usually about 3 ml.
13. Make 100 ul aliquots on dry ice.  A good way to do this is to place open, sterile, labeled tubes in a freezer box and place it in a dry ice-filled styrofoam box to chill.
14. Store tubes at –70<sup>o</sup>C.
15. To electroporate:
- Chill on ice a 0.1 cm cuvette that contains 50 ul sterile water.  Keep the cuvette on ice until the electroporation.
- Add your DNA.  
  - I typically use 3 ul out of a 15 ul ligation reaction.  
  - I’ve tried up to 7 ul of a ligation without arcing.
- Add 30 ul of electrocompetent cells.
- Just before electroporating, mix by flicking the cuvette and dry the outside of the cuvette with a kimwipe.
- Shock at 200 ohms, 25 uF, 2.0 kV. (the Bamberg lab electroporator units for ‘set volts’ is kV) The time constants should be 3.3-4.3 msec.
- Add 1 ml of room temperature LB.  Pipette a few times to gently mix and transfer to a sterile 1.5 ml tube.
- Let recover for 45-60 min at 37<sup>o</sup>C (no shaking).
- Pellet at 16,000g in a microfuge for 2 min.  Remove most of the supernatant, leaving about 150 ul.
- Resuspend the bacteria and spread on an appropriate selective plate.
16. To clean the cuvettes:
- Soak the cuvettes and caps in 1-2 % bleach for about 15 min.
  - (16.66 mL)(6% bleach)=(50 mL)(2% bleach)
- Rinse well.
- Rinse the cuvettes and caps in 95 % ethanol.
- Dry upside down on a clean kimwipe before recapping and storing for the next use.
