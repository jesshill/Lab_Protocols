## CCMB80 buffer
- 10 mM KOAc pH 7.0 (10 ml of a 1M stock/L)
- 80 mM CaCl2 * 2H2O (11.8 g/L)
- 20 mM MnCl2 * 4H2O (4.0 g/L)
- 10 mM MgCl2 * 6H2O (2.0 g/L)
- 10% glycerol (100 ml/L)

adjust pH DOWN to 6.4 with 0.1N HCl if necessary

NOTE: adjusting pH up will precipitate manganese dioxide from Mn containing solutions.

sterile filter and store at 4C

slight dark precipitate appears not to affect its function

### Procedure

Detergent is a major inhibitor of competent cell growth and transformation.  Glass and plastic
must be detergent free for these protocols.  The easiest way to do this is to avoid washing
glassware, and simply rinse it out.  Autoclaving glassware filled 3/4 with DI water is an effective
way to remove most detergent residue.  

Media and buffers should be prepared in detergent free glassware and cultures grown up in detergent free glassware.

#### <ins>Prechill plasticware and glassware<ins>
Prechill 250mL centrifuge tubes and screw cap tubes before use.


#### <ins>Preparing competent cells<ins>
Inoculate 250 ml of [[SOB]] medium with 1 ml vial of seed stock and grow at 20C to an OD600nm of 0.3

- This takes approximately 16 hours.
- Controlling the temperature makes this a more reproducible process, but is not essential.
- Room temperature will work.  You can adjust this temperature somewhat to fit your schedule
- Aim for lower, not higher OD if you can't hit this mark
  - snap cool in ice/water bath.

Centrifuge at 3000g at 4C for 10 minutes in a flat bottom centrifuge bottle.
- Flat bottom centrifuge tubes make the fragile cells much easier to resuspend
- It is often easier to resuspend pellets by mixing ''before'' adding large amounts of buffer

Gently resuspend in 80 ml of ice cold CCMB80 buffer
- sometimes this is less than completely gentle.  It still works.

Incubate on ice 20 minutes

Centrifuge again at 4&deg;C and resuspend in 10 ml of ice cold CCMB80 buffer.

Test OD of a mixture of 200 &mu;l SOC and 50 &mu;l of the resuspended cells.

Add chilled CCMB80 to yield a final OD of 1.0-1.5 in this test.  

Incubate on ice for 20 minutes

Aliquot to chilled screw top 2 ml vials or 50 &mu;l into chilled microtiter plates

Store at -80&deg;C indefinitely.
- Flash freezing does not appear to be necessary

Test competence (see below)

Thawing and  refreezing partially used cell aliquots dramatically reduces transformation efficiency by about 3x the first time, and about 6x total after several freeze/thaw cycles.

#### <ins>Measurement of competence<ins>

Transform 50 &mu;l of cells with 1 &mu;l of standard pUC19 plasmid (Invitrogen)
- This is at 10 pg/&mu;l or 10<sup>-5</sup> &mu;g/&mu;l
- This can be made by diluting 1 &mu;l of NEB pUC19 plasmid (1 &mu;g/&mu;l, NEB part number N3401S) into 100 ml of TE

Hold on ice 0.5 hours

Heat shock 60 sec at 42C

Add 250 ul [[SOC]]

Incubate at 37 C for 1 hour in 2 ml centrifuge tubes rotated
- using 2ml centrifuge tubes for transformation and regrowth works well because the small volumes flow well when rotated, increasing aeration.
- For our plasmids (pSB1AC3, pSB1AT3) which are chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistant, we find growing for 2 hours yields many more colonies
- Ampicillin and kanamycin appear to do fine with 1  hour growth

Plate 20 ul on AMP plates using sterile 3.5 mm glass beads
- Good cells should yield around 100 - 400 colonies
- Transformation efficiency is (dilution factor=15) x colony count x 10<sup>5</sup>/µgDNA
- We expect that the transformation efficiency should be between 5x10<sup>8</sup> and 5x10<sup>9</sup> cfu/µgDNA
