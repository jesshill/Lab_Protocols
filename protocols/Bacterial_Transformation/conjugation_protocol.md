### PROCEDURE

Four-parental mating conjugation 

1. Grow overnight a 4 mL culture of the strain(s) for conjugation with appropriate antibiotics as needed. 
   1. For example: JUB134 (recipient strain), p65032 (donor strain; expression vector), p64967 (donor strain; helper plasmid), pRK2013 (donor strain; mobilizer)
1. Pipette 0.1 mL of each culture into a microcentrifuge tube containing 0.6 mL of LB medium. 
1. Centrifuge for 2 min at RT and reduced speed (7,000 g). Reduced speeds yield softer cell pellets, which are easy to suspend and therefore minimize damage to cell surface pili required for conjugation. 
1. Aspirate supernatant, suspend cell pellet in 1 mL of LB medium and centrifuge (7,000 g, 2 min, and RT). 
1. Repeat step 4 one time.
1. Aspirate supernatant and suspend cell pellet in 30 uL of LB medium. 
1. Pipette the whole cell suspension for each bacteria (recipient and donor strains) onto a non-selective LB agar plate and incubate at the appropriate temperature (i.e., 25C or 37C) for at least 5 hours (can be extended to overnight). The non-selective medium is required to avoid killing non-transformed recipient cells. 
1. Post-mating: 
   1. Add 1 mL of LB medium to the conjugation plate and rinse off the whole bacterial spot. Transfer the sample to a microfuge tube.
   1. Alternatively, scrape off whole bacterial spot with an inoculation loop into a microfuge tube containing LB. 
1. Centrifuge (2 min, RT, 16,000 g) and aspirate supernatant. 
1. Resuspend in 1 mL of LB. 
1. Centrifuge (2 min, RT, 16,000 g) and aspirate supernatant.
1. Depending on the pellet size, resuspend in 0.2 mL – 1 mL of LB.
1. Plate 50 – 100 uL of sample on appropriate selection plate and spread. 
1. Let the sample dry on the plate. 
1. Place the plate in the incubator at the appropriate temperature for the recipient strain and culture o/n. 
1. Check for colonies of trans-conjugates the next day.
