### CCMB80 buffer

|**Reagent**|**[Stock] or MW**|**[Final]**|**Amount for 150 ml**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|KOAc|98\.14 g/mol|10 mM|0\.147 g|
|CaCl<sub>2</sub>•2H<sub>2</sub>0|147\.02 g/mol|80 mM|1\.76 g|
|MnCl<sub>2</sub>|125\.84 g/mol|20 mM|0\.378 g|
|MgCl<sub>2</sub>|1 M|10 mM|1\.5 ml|
|glycerol|100% @ 1.26 g/ml|10% (v/v)|18\.9 g|

- Work with detergent-free glass and plasticware (see notes)
- Adjust pH DOWN to 6.4 with 0.1 N HCl, if necessary, but do not adjust up.
- Sterile filter using a new Stericup filter and bottle and store at 4°C

**SOB medium**

|**Reagent**|**[Stock] or MW**|**[Final]**|**Amount for 300 ml**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|Bactotryptone|-|2 %|6 g|
|Yeast extract|-|0\.5 %|1\.5 g|
|NaCl|5 M|10 mM|0\.6 ml|
|KCl|3 M|2\.5 mM|0\.25 ml|
|MgCl<sub>2</sub>|1 M|10 mM|3 ml|
|MgSO<sub>4•</sub>7H<sub>2</sub>0|246\.47 g/mol|10 mM|0\.739 g|

- Work with detergent-free glass and plasticware
- Adjust to pH 7.0 with1 M NaOH.
- Set aside 40 ml for making an SOB plate (add 0.6 g agar)
- Autoclave 20 min
- Before inoculating, set aside ~5 ml of SOB for the overnight culture and OD<sub>600</sub> readings.

### Preparing competent cells

- Streak E.coli on an SOB plate, grow to colonies at room temp (2-3 days).
- Inoculate a single colony into 2 ml of SOB, grow overnight at 20°C with shaking.
- Inoculate 250 ml SOB medium with 0.5 ml the overnight culture, grow at 20°C to OD<sub>600</sub>=0.3
  - This takes approximately 12-15 hours. Others grow at 37°C for 2-3 hrs.
  - Aim for lower, not higher OD if you can't hit this mark
- Centrifuge at 3000 rpm at 4°C for 10 minutes in a flat bottom centrifuge bottle.
  - Prechill the sterile, flat-bottomed centrifuge bottle on ice
  - Flat bottom centrifuge tubes make the fragile cells easier to resuspend
  - It is easier to resuspend pellets in a small volume *before* adding the full volume of buffer
- Discard supernatant by pouring out slowly then pipetting remaining supernatant
- Gently resuspend in 80 ml of ice cold CCMB80 buffer.
- Incubate on ice 20 minutes.
- Centrifuge again at 4°C and discard supernatant as described above.
- Resuspend in 10 ml of ice cold CCMB80 buffer.
- Test OD<sub>600</sub> of a mixture of 800 μl SOB and 200 μl of the resuspended cells.
  - If necessary, add chilled CCMB80 to yield an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.0-1.5 in this test.
- Aliquot to prechilled, sterile microfuge tubes
  - 110 µl aliquots, enough for 2 transformations per tube
  - Store at -80°C indefinitely.
- Test competence (see notes)

**Notes**

- Detergent is a major inhibitor of competent cell growth and transformation. Glass and plastic must be detergent free for these protocols. The easiest way to do this is to avoid washing glassware, and simply rinse it out. Autoclaving glassware filled 3/4 with DI water is an effective way to remove most detergent residue. Media and buffers should be prepared in detergent free glassware and cultures grown up in detergent free glassware.
- Needed detergent-free glass and plasticware: 1 L culture flask and stir bar, 200 ml beaker and stir bar, 250 ml graduated cylinder, 1 L sterile centrifuge bottle, sterile easy-open 0.65 ml tubes, sterile p1000 and p200 tips.
- Keeping cells cold is important. Prechill all centrifuge tubes, autoclaves tubes, and use a metal cold block when appropriate.
- Snap freezing aliquots in LN<sub>2</sub> is not necessary.
- Freeze/thaw of competent cell aliquots greatly decreases transformation efficiency: 3x from each freeze/thaw
- Test competence with a transformation of 10 pg of plasmid. The transformation efficiency should be between 5x10<sup>8</sup> and 5x10<sup>9</sup> cfu/µg.
- Adapted from <https://openwetware.org/wiki/TOP10_chemically_competent_cells>, which is from Methods Enzymol. 1991;204:63-113
- This protocol has been used successfully with BL21(DE3), DH5α, and TOP10 strains.
