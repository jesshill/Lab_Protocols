### Protocol 

- Thaw an aliquot of competent *E. coli* on ice*.* 
  - Use TOP10 cells for general transformation and dB3.1 cells for any plasmid with the cCdB gene. 
  - Be nice to the cells. Competent cells are very fragile. No vortexing, don’t leave them thawed for too long. Don’t refreeze aliquots of cells.
- Turn the 42°C heat block on and add water to the block.
- Add plasmid DNA to 50 ul of thawed competent cells. 
  - I usually add 1 ul of miniprep DNA or 10 ul of Gibson assembly.
  - Do a positive and negative control!
- Incubate cells on ice for 30 minutes.
- Heat shock cells at 42°C for 1 minute in the heat block.
- Incubate cells on ice for 5 minutes.
- Add 250 ul of liquid LB media to the cells.
- Incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
- Spread on an LB-antibiotic plate
  - Our antibiotic of choice is almost always ampicillin.
- Incubate overnight at 	37°C.
  - Put plates in a plastic bin, the incubator will dry them out otherwise.
