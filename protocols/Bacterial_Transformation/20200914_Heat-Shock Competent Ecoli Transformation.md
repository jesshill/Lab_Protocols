### Protocol:

1. Preheat heat block or water bath to 42°C. Bring LB and LB plates to room temp.
1. Thaw DH5α aliquot(s) on ice. Aliquots are 100 µl, sufficient for 2 transformations. Keep cold. Prechill a 1.5 ml microfuges tube for each transformation.
1. Add DNA (ligation reaction or ~10-100 ng plasmid DNA) to 50 µl of DH5α in the cold 1.5 ml tube. Gently mix.
1. Incubate on ice 30 min.
1. Heat shock 30 sec in 42°C. Back to ice ~1 min.
1. Add 250 µl LB. Recover shaking at 37°C, 1 hour.
1. Spread an appropriate portion of the resuspended bacteria on selection plates. Grow overnight (16-20 hours) upside down at 37°C.

### Quick Transformation Alternative:

1. Preheat heat block or water bath to 42°C. Bring LB and LB plates to room temp.
1. Thaw DH5α aliquot(s) on ice. Aliquots are 100 µl, sufficient for 2 transformations. Keep cold. Prechill a 1.5 ml microfuges tube for each transformation.
1. Add DNA (ligation reaction or ~10-100 ng plasmid DNA) to 50 µl of DH5α in the cold 1.5 ml tube. Gently mix.
1. Incubate on ice **10** **min**.
1. Heat shock 30 sec in 42°C. Back to ice ~1 min.
1. Add 250 µl LB. Recover at **room temp,** **10 min**.
1. Spread an appropriate portion of the resuspended bacteria on selection plates. Grow overnight (16-20 hours) upside down at 37°C.

### Compromise Transformation Protocol:

1. Preheat heat block or water bath to 42°C. Bring LB and LB plate(s) to room temp.
1. Thaw DH5α aliquot(s) on ice. Aliquots are 100 µl, sufficient for 2 transformations. Keep cold. Prechill a 1.5 ml microfuges tube for each transformation.
1. Add DNA (ligation reaction or ~10-100 ng plasmid DNA) to 50 µl of DH5α in the cold 1.5 ml tube. Gently mix.
1. Incubate on ice **15** **min**.
1. Heat shock 30 sec in 42°C. Back to ice ~1 min.
1. Add 250 µl LB. Recover shaking at **37°C,** **20 min**.
1. Spread an appropriate portion of the resuspended bacteria on selection plates. Grow overnight (16-20 hours) upside down at 37°C.
