Notes from tech support:
** called to try and get thoughts on how to troubleshoot inconsistencies observed in needle pulling 


1) The drierite (desiccant): 
blue = not saturated with moisture
purple = saturated with moisture 

as long as their is any amount of blue left, we should be fine. There shouldn't be moisture in the air line. 

2) For trouble shooting purposes, see the 15 questions technical document on the sutter instruments website. 

can email adam@sutter.com with additional questions

3) The ramp value should decrease with usage, because the ramp value is proportional to the mass of the heating filament. So as the heating element/filament gets used more, its mass decreases and the thus the ramp value decreases. 

4) the stability of certain program settings:
example, the low velocity of (30) in my program line 1: because it is on the lower end of the machines limit/sensitivity, it is inherently unstable. Meaning it is more sensitive to fluctuations in the machine, other program settings, deformaties in capillary dimensions, etc. 
 
dimensional tolerances become more important further down the program, as it gets closer to the needle pulling aspect. 

for line one in my 2 line program, I had the velocity set to 30. This adam said is a bit unstable. This could be an issue. He suggested trialing moving up or down in this parameter by 1 - 3 units at a time, and see how this improves the stability of the needles pulled. 


5) alternate approach to loading needles:
try putting the needle tip into the solution and let the mix pull up the needle.
can do multiple needles at once this way.
